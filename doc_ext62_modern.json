For example {@link Ext#method!getCmp Ext.getCmp} aliases\n{@link Ext.ComponentManager#method!get Ext.ComponentManager.get}.\n\nMany applications are initiated with {@link Ext#method!application Ext.application} which is\ncalled once the DOM is ready. This ensures all scripts have been loaded, preventing\ndependency issues. For example:\n\n     Ext.application({\n         name: 'MyApp',\n\n         launch: function () {\n             Ext.Msg.alert(this.name, 'Ready to go!');\n         }\n     });\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/\">Sencha Cmd</a></b> is a free tool\nfor helping you generate and build Ext JS (and Sencha Touch) applications.

        "doc": "Represents an Ext JS application, which is typically a single page app using a\n{@link Ext.container.Viewport Viewport}.\n\nAn application consists of one or more Views. The behavior of a View is managed by its\ncorresponding {@link Ext.app.ViewController} and {@link Ext.app.ViewModel}.\n\nGlobal activities are coordinated by {@link Ext.app.Controller} which are\nultimately instantiated by an instance of this (or a derived) class.\n\n    Ext.application({\n        name: 'MyApp',\n\n        // The name of the initial view to create. With the classic toolkit this class\n        // will gain a \"viewport\" plugin if it does not extend Ext.Viewport. With the\n        // modern toolkit, the main view will be added to the Viewport.\n        //\n        //mainView: 'Main.view.main.Main'\n    });\n\nThis does several things. First it creates a global variable called 'MyApp' - all of\nyour Application's classes (such as its Models, Views and Controllers) will reside under\nthis single namespace, which drastically lowers the chances of colliding global variables.\n\nThe MyApp global will also have a getApplication method to get a reference to the current\napplication:\n\n    var app = MyApp.getApplication();\n\n# Telling Application about the rest of the app\n\nBecause an Ext.app.Application represents an entire app, we should tell it about the other\nparts of the app - namely the Models, Views and Controllers that are bundled with the application. Let's say we have\na blog management app; we might have Models and Controllers for Posts and Comments, and Views for listing,\nadding and editing Posts and Comments. Here's how we'd tell our Application about all these things:\n\n    Ext.application({\n        name: 'Blog',\n\n        models: ['Post', 'Comment'],\n\n        controllers: ['Posts', 'Comments'],\n\n        launch: function() {\n            ...\n        }\n    });\n\nNote that we didn't actually list the Views directly in the Application itself. This is because Views are managed by\nControllers, so it makes sense to keep those dependencies there. The Application will load each of the specified\nControllers using the pathing conventions laid out in the\n[application architecture guide](../guides/application_architecture/application_architecture.html) - in this case\nexpecting the controllers to reside in app/controller/Posts.js and app/controller/Comments.js. In turn, each\nController simply needs to list the Views it uses and they will be automatically loaded. Here's how our Posts\ncontroller like be defined:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.controller.Posts', {\n        extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',\n        views: ['posts.List', 'posts.Edit'],\n\n        //the rest of the Controller here\n    });\n\nBecause we told our Application about our Models and Controllers, and our Controllers about their Views, Ext JS will\nautomatically load all of our app files for us. This means we don't have to manually add script tags into our html\nfiles whenever we add a new class, but more importantly it enables us to create a minimized build of our entire\napplication using Sencha Cmd.\n\n# Deriving from Ext.app.Application\n\nTypically, applications do not derive directly from Ext.app.Application. Rather, the\nconfiguration passed to `Ext.application` mimics what you might do in a derived class.\nIn some cases, however, it can be desirable to share logic by using a derived class\nfrom `{@link Ext.app.Application}`.\n\nDerivation works as you would expect, but using the derived class should still be the\njob of the `Ext.application` method.\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.Application', {\n        extend: 'Ext.app.Application',\n        name: 'MyApp',\n        ...\n    });\n\n    Ext.application('MyApp.Application');\n\nFor more information about writing Ext JS applications, please see\nthe [application architecture guide](../guides/application_architecture/application_architecture.html).\n",

Executing `action.resume();` will continue\nthe action, `action.stop();` will not allow the action to resume but will allow other queued actions to resume,\n`action.stop(true);` will not allow the action and any other queued actions to resume.\n\nThe default RegEx that will be used is `([%a-zA-Z0-9\\\\-\\\\_\\\\s,]+)` but you can specify any\nthat may suit what you need to accomplish.

The following means the\nsame thing as above:\n\n     formulas: {\n         xy: {\n             get: function (get) { return get('x') * get('y'); }\n         }\n     }\n\n### Data Dependencies\n\nOne of the important aspects of a `ViewModel` is notification of change. In order to\nmanage this, a `ViewModel` *must* know the dependencies between data. In the above case\nthis is accomplished by **parsing the text of the function**. While this is convenient\nand reduces the maintenance/risk that would come from explicitly listing dependencies\nseparately, there are some rules to be aware of:\n\n  * All dependencies are resolved by matching the binding statements in the getter function.\n  * If you need to use these values in other ways, cache them as a `var` (following\n    the first rule to capture the value) and use that `var`.\n\nIn the above formulas, the \"xy\" formula depends on \"x\" and \"y\" in the `ViewModel`. As\nthese values change, the formula is called to produce the correct value for \"xy\". This\nin turn can be used by other formulas. For example:\n\n     formulas: {\n         xy: function (get) {  // \"get\" is arbitrary but a good convention\n             return get('x') * get('y');\n         },\n\n         xyz: function (get) {\n             return get('xy') * get('z');\n         }\n     }\n\nIn the above, \"xyz\" depends on \"xy\" and \"z\" values in the `ViewModel`.\n\n### The Getter Method\n\nThe argument passed to the formula is a function that allows you to retrieve\nthe matched bind statements.\n\n     formulas: {\n         foo: function (get) {\n             return get('theUser.address.city');\n         }\n     }\n\nIn the above, the dependency is resolved to `theUser.address.city`. The formula will not\nbe triggered until the value for `city` is present.\n\n### Capturing Values\n\nIf values need to be used repeatedly, you can use a `var` as long as the Rules are not\nbroken.\n\n     formulas: {\n         x2y2: function (get) {\n             // These are still \"visible\" as \"get('x')\" and \"get('y')\" so this is OK:\n             var x = get('x'),\n                 y = get('y');\n\n             return x * x * y * y;\n         }\n     }\n\n## Explicit Binding\n\nWhile function parsing is convenient, there are times it is not the best solution. In\nthese cases, an explicit `{@link #cfg!bind bind}` can be given. To revisit the previous example with an\nexplicit binding:\n\n     formulas: {\n         zip: {\n             bind: '{foo.bar.zip}',\n\n             get: function (zip) {\n                 // NOTE: the only thing we get is what our bind produces.\n                 return zip * 2;\n             }\n         }\n     }\n\nIn this case we have given the formula an explicit `{@link #cfg!bind bind}` value so it will no longer\nparse the `{@link #cfg!get get}` function. Instead, it will call `{@link Ext.app.ViewModel#method!bind Ext.app.ViewModel#bind}` with\nthe value of the `{@link #cfg!bind bind}` property and pass the produced value to `{@link #cfg!get get}` whenever it\nchanges.\n\n## Settable Formulas\n\nWhen a formula is \"reversible\" it can be given a `{@link #cfg!set set}` method to allow it to participate\nin two-way binding. For example:\n\n     formulas: {\n            fullName: {\n                get: function (get) {\n                    var ret = get('firstName') || '';\n\n                    if (get('lastName')) {\n                        ret += ' ' +  get('lastName');\n                    }\n\n                    return ret;\n                },\n\n                set: function (value) {\n                    var space = value.indexOf(' '),\n                        split = (space < 0) ? value.length : space;\n\n                    this.set({\n                        firstName: value.substring(0, split),\n                        lastName: value.substring(split + 1)\n                    });\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\nWhen the `{@link #cfg!set set}` method is called the `this` reference is the `{@link Ext.app.ViewModel}` so it\njust calls its `{@link Ext.app.ViewModel#method!set set method}`.\n\n## Single Run Formulas\n\nIf a formula only needs to produce an initial value, it can be marked as `{@link #cfg!single single}`.\n\n     formulas: {\n         xy: {\n             single: true,\n\n             get: function (get) {\n                 return get('x') * get('y');\n             }\n         }\n     }\n\nThis formulas `{@link #cfg!get get}` method will be called with `x` and `y` once and then its binding\nto these properties will be destroyed. This means the `{@link #cfg!get get}` method (and hence the value\nof `xy`) will only be executed/calculated once.\n",

        "doc": "Controllers are the glue that binds an application together. That said, their main\npurpose is to listen for events (usually from views) and take some action. Here's how\nwe might create a Controller to manage Users:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.controller.Users', {\n         extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',\n\n         init: function() {\n             console.log('Initialized Users! This happens before ' +\n                         'the Application launch() function is called');\n         }\n     });\n\nThe init function is a special method that is called when your application boots. It is\ncalled before the {@link Ext.app.Application}'s launch function is executed.\nThis creates an area you can run code prior to Viewport creation.\n\nThe controller's {@link #method!control #method-control} function\nmakes it easy to listen to events on your view classes and take some action with a\nhandler function. Let's update our Users controller to tell us when the panel is\nrendered:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.controller.Users', {\n         extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',\n\n         control: {\n             'viewport > panel': {\n                 render: 'onPanelRendered'\n             }\n         }\n\n         onPanelRendered: function() {\n             console.log('The panel was rendered');\n         }\n     });\n\nThe {@link Ext.app.BaseController#method!control control method} has now set up\nlisteners on views in our application. The control method uses the ComponentQuery\nengine to quickly and easily get references to components on the page. If you are not\nfamiliar with ComponentQuery yet, be sure to check out the\n{@link Ext.ComponentQuery}. In brief, it allows us to pass a\nCSS-like selector that will find every matching component on the page.\n\nIn our init function above, we supplied 'viewport > panel', which translates to \"find me\nevery Panel that is a direct child of a Viewport\". We then supplied an object that maps\nevent names (just 'render' in this case) to handler functions. In short, whenever\na component that matches our selector fires a 'render' event, our\nonPanelRendered function is called.\n\n## Event domains\n\nIn Ext JS 4.2, we introduced the concept of event domains. In terms of MVC, an event\ndomain is one or more base classes that fire events to which a Controller wants to\nlisten. Besides Component event domain that encompass {@link Ext.Component}-descended\nViews, Controllers now can listen to events from data Stores, Ext Direct Providers,\nother Controllers, and Ext.GlobalEvents. This feature provides a way to communicate\nbetween parts of the whole application without the need to bind controllers together\ntightly, and allows to develop and test application parts in isolation.\n\nSee usage examples in {@link #method!listen #method-listen} method documentation.\n\n## Using refs\n\nOne of the most useful parts of Controllers is the ref system. These use\n{@link Ext.ComponentQuery} to make it really easy to get references to Views on your\npage. Let's look at an example of this now:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.controller.Users', {\n         extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',\n\n         refs: [{\n             ref: 'list',\n             selector: 'grid'\n         }],\n\n         control: {\n             'button': {\n                 click: 'refreshGrid'\n             }\n         },\n\n         refreshGrid: function() {\n             this.getList().store.load();\n         }\n     });\n\nThis example assumes the existence of a {@link Ext.grid.Panel Grid} on the page, which\ncontains a single button to refresh the Grid when clicked. In our refs array, we set up\na reference to the grid. There are two parts to this - the 'selector', which is a\n{@link Ext.ComponentQuery} selector which finds any grid on the page and\nassigns it to the reference 'list'.\n\nBy giving the reference a name, we get a number of things for free. The first is the\ngetList function that we use in the refreshGrid method above. This is generated\nautomatically by the Controller based on the name of our ref, which was capitalized and\nprepended with get to go from 'list' to 'getList'.\n\nThe way this works is that the first time getList is called by your code, the\nComponentQuery selector is run and the first component that matches the selector\n('grid' in this case) will be returned. All future calls to getList will use a cached\nreference to that grid. Usually it is advised to use a specific ComponentQuery selector\nthat will only match a single View in your application (in the case above our selector\nwill match any grid on the page).\n\nBringing it all together, we configure control\nto listen to any click on a {@link Ext.button.Button button} and call our refreshGrid\nfunction (again, this will match any button on the page so we advise a more specific\nselector than just 'button', but have left it this way for simplicity). When the button\nis clicked we use out getList function to refresh the grid.\n\nYou can create any number of refs and control any number of components this way, simply\nadding more functions to your Controller as you go. For an example of real-world usage\nof Controllers see the Feed Viewer example in the examples/app/feed-viewer folder in\nthe SDK download.\n\n## Generated getter methods\n\nRefs aren't the only thing that generate convenient getter methods. Controllers often\nhave to deal with Models and Stores so the framework offers a couple of easy ways to\nget access to those too. Let's look at another example:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.controller.Users', {\n         extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',\n\n         models: ['User'],\n         stores: ['AllUsers', 'AdminUsers'],\n\n         init: function() {\n             var User, allUsers, ed;\n\n             User = this.getUserModel();\n             allUsers = this.getAllUsersStore();\n\n             ed = new User({ name: 'Ed' });\n             allUsers.add(ed);\n         }\n     });\n\nBy specifying Models and Stores that the Controller cares about, it again dynamically\nloads them from the appropriate locations (app/model/User.js, app/store/AllUsers.js and\napp/store/AdminUsers.js in this case) and creates getter functions for them all. The\nexample above will create a new User model instance and add it to the AllUsers Store.\nOf course, you could do anything in this function but in this case we just did\nsomething simple to demonstrate the functionality.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nFor more information about writing Ext JS 5 applications, please see the\n[Application Architecture](../../../application_architecture/application_architecture.html).\nAlso see the {@link Ext.app.Application} documentation.\n",

A\ncontroller listens to events by describing the selectors for events of interest to it.\n\nMatching selectors to the firer of an event is one key aspect that defines an event\ndomain. All event domain instances must provide a `{@link #method!match match}` method that tests selectors\nagainst the event firer.\n\nWhen an event domain instance is created (typically as a `singleton`), its `type`\nproperty is used to catalog the domain in the\n{@link Ext.app.EventDomain#static-property!instances Ext.app.EventDomain.instances} map.\n\nThere are five event domains provided by default:\n\n-   {@link Ext.app.domain.Component}. This is the primary event domain that\nhas been available since Ext JS MVC was introduced. This domain is defined as any class that\nextends {@link Ext.Component}, where the selectors use\n{@link Ext.ComponentQuery#method!query Ext.ComponentQuery}.\n-   {@link Ext.app.domain.Global}. This domain provides Controllers with access\nto events fired from {@link Ext.GlobalEvents} Observable instance.

This domain includes all classes\nthat extend {@link Ext.app.Controller}. Events fired by Controllers will be available\nwithin this domain; selectors are either Controller's {@link Ext.app.Controller#cfg!id id} or\n'*' wildcard for any Controller.\n-   {@link Ext.app.domain.Store}.

        "doc": "A Profile represents a range of devices that fall under a common category. For the vast majority of apps that use\ndevice profiles, the app defines a Phone profile and a Tablet profile. Doing this enables you to easily customize\nthe experience for the different sized screens offered by those device types.\n\nOnly one Profile can be active at a time, and each Profile defines a simple {@link #method!isActive #isActive} function that should\nreturn either true or false. The first Profile to return true from its isActive function is set as your Application's\n{@link Ext.app.Application#cfg!currentProfile current profile}.\n\nA Profile can define any number of {@link #cfg!models #models}, {@link #cfg!views #views}, {@link #cfg!controllers #controllers} and {@link #cfg!stores #stores} which\nwill be loaded if the Profile is activated. It can also define a {@link #method!launch #launch} function that will be called after\nall of its dependencies have been loaded, just before the {@link Ext.app.Application#method!launch application launch}\nfunction is called.\n\n## Sample Usage\n\nFirst you need to tell your Application about your Profile(s):\n\n    Ext.application({\n        name: 'MyApp',\n        profiles: ['Phone', 'Tablet']\n    });\n\nThis will load app/profile/Phone.js and app/profile/Tablet.js. Here's how we might define the Phone profile:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.profile.Phone', {\n        extend: 'Ext.app.Profile',\n\n        views: ['Main'],\n\n        isActive: function() {\n            return Ext.os.is('Phone');\n        }\n    });\n\nThe isActive function returns true if we detect that we are running on a phone device. If that is the case the\nApplication will set this Profile active and load the 'Main' view specified in the Profile's {@link #cfg!views #views} config.\n\n## Class Specializations\n\nBecause Profiles are specializations of an application, all of the models, views, controllers and stores defined\nin a Profile are expected to be namespaced under the name of the Profile. Here's an expanded form of the example\nabove:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.profile.Phone', {\n        extend: 'Ext.app.Profile',\n\n        views: ['Main'],\n        controllers: ['Signup'],\n        models: ['MyApp.model.Group'],\n\n        isActive: function() {\n            return Ext.os.is('Phone');\n        }\n    });\n\nIn this case, the Profile is going to load *app/view/phone/Main.js*, *app/controller/phone/Signup.js* and\n*app/model/Group.js*. Notice that in each of the first two cases the name of the profile ('phone' in this case) was\ninjected into the class names. In the third case we specified the full Model name (for Group) so the Profile name\nwas not injected.\n\nFor a fuller understanding of the ideas behind Profiles and how best to use them in your app, we suggest you read\nthe [device profiles guide](/touch/2.4/core_concepts/device_profiles.html).\n",

Bindings ultimately derive from `{@link Ext.app.bind.BaseBinding}`\nwhich provides several methods to help manage the binding.\n\nPerhaps the most important method is `{@link #method!destroy destroy}`. When the binding is no longer needed\nit is important to remember to `{@link #method!destroy destroy}` it. Leaking bindings can cause performance\nproblems or worse when callbacks are called at unexpected times.\n\nThe types of bindings produced by `{@link #method!bind bind}` are:\n\n  * `{@link Ext.app.bind.Binding}`\n  * `{@link Ext.app.bind.Multi}`\n  * `{@link Ext.app.bind.TemplateBinding}`\n\n## Bind Descriptors\n\nA \"bind descriptor\" is a value (a String, an Object or an array of these) that describe\nthe desired data. Any piece of data in the `ViewModel` can be described by a bind\ndescriptor.\n\n### Textual Bind Descriptors\n\nThe simplest and most common form of bind descriptors are strings that look like an\n`{@link Ext.Template}` containing text and tokens surrounded by \"{}\" with dot notation inside\nto traverse objects and their properties.\n\nFor example:\n\n  * `'Hello {user.name}!'`\n  * `'You have selected \"{selectedItem.text}\".'`\n  * `'{!isDisabled}'`\n  * `'{a > b ? \"Bigger\" : \"Smaller\"}'`\n  * `'{user.groups}'`\n\nAll except the last are `{@link Ext.app.bind.TemplateBinding}`\nwhich use the familiar `{@link Ext.Template}` syntax with some slight differences. For more on\ntemplates see `{@link Ext.app.bind.Template}`.\n\nThe last descriptor is called a \"direct bind descriptor\". This special form of\nbind maps one-to-one to some piece of data in the `ViewModel` and is managed by the\n`{@link Ext.app.bind.Binding}` class.\n\n#### Two-Way Descriptors\n\nA direct bind descriptor may be able to write back a value to the `ViewModel` as well\nas retrieve one. When this is the case, they are said to be \"two-way\". For example:\n\n     var binding = viewModel.bind('{s}', function(s) { console.log('s=' + s); });\n\n     binding.setValue('abc');\n\nDirect use of `ViewModel` in this way is not commonly needed because `{@link Ext.Component}`\nautomates this process. For example, a `textfield` component understands when it is\ngiven a \"two-way\" binding and automatically synchronizes its value bidirectionally using\nthe above technique. For example:\n\n     Ext.widget({\n         items: [{\n             xtype: 'textfield',\n             bind: '{s}'  // a two-way / direct bind descriptor\n         }]\n     });\n\n### Object and Array Descriptors / Multi-Bind\n\nWith two exceptions (see below) an Object is interpreted as a \"shape\" to produce by\ntreating each of its properties as individual bind descriptors. An object of the same\nshape is passed as the value of the bind except that each property is populated with\nthe appropriate value. Of course, this definition is recursive, so these properties\nmay also be objects.\n\nFor example:\n\n     viewModel.bind({\n             x: '{x}',\n             foo: {\n                 bar: 'Hello {foo.bar}'\n             }\n         },\n         function (obj) {\n             //  obj = {\n             //      x: 42,\n             //      foo: {\n             //          bar: 'Hello foobar'\n             //      }\n             //  }\n         });\n\nArrays are handled in the same way. Each element of the array is considered a bind\ndescriptor (recursively) and the value produced for the binding is an array with each\nelement set to the bound property.\n\n### Bind Options\n\nOne exception to the \"object is a multi-bind\" rule is when that object contains a\n`bindTo` property. When an object contains a `bindTo` property the object is understood\nto contain bind options and the value of `bindTo` is considered the actual bind\ndescriptor.\n\nFor example:\n\n     viewModel.bind({\n             bindTo: '{x}',\n             single: true\n         },\n         function (x) {\n             console.log('x: ' + x); // only called once\n         });\n\nThe available bind options depend on the type of binding, but since all bindings\nderive from `{@link Ext.app.bind.BaseBinding}` its options are always applicable.\nFor a list of the other types of bindings, see above.\n\n#### Deep Binding\n\nWhen a direct bind is made and the bound property is an object, by default the binding\ncallback is only called when that reference changes. This is the most efficient way to\nunderstand a bind of this type, but sometimes you may need to be notified if any of the\nproperties of that object change.\n\nTo do this, we create a \"deep bind\":\n\n     viewModel.bind({\n             bindTo: '{someObject}',\n             deep: true\n         },\n         function (someObject) {\n             // called when reference changes or *any* property changes\n         });\n\n#### Binding Timings\n\nThe `ViewModel` has a {@link #cfg!scheduler #scheduler} attached that is used to coordinate the firing of bindings.\nIt serves 2 main purposes:\n- To coordinate dependencies between bindings. This means bindings will be fired in an order such that\nthe any dependencies for a binding are fired before the binding itself.\n- To batch binding firings. The scheduler runs on a short timer, so the following code will only trigger\na single binding (the last), the changes in between will never be triggered.\n\n    viewModel.bind('{val}', function(v) {\n        console.log(v);\n    });\n    viewModel.set('val', 1);\n    viewModel.set('val', 2);\n    viewModel.set('val', 3);\n    viewModel.set('val', 4);\n\nThe `ViewModel` can be forced to process by calling `{@link #method!notify #notify}`, which will force the\nscheduler to run immediately in the current state.\n\n    viewModel.bind('{val}', function(v) {\n        console.log(v);\n    });\n    viewModel.set('val', 1);\n    viewModel.notify();\n    viewModel.set('val', 2);\n    viewModel.notify();\n    viewModel.set('val', 3);\n    viewModel.notify();\n    viewModel.set('val', 4);\n    viewModel.notify();\n\n\n#### Models, Stores and Associations\n\nA {@link Ext.data.Session} manages model instances and their associations.\nThe `ViewModel` may be used with or without a `Session`. When a `Session` is attached, the\n`ViewModel` will always consult the `Session` to ask about records and stores. The `Session`\nensures that only a single instance of each model Type/Id combination is created. This is\nimportant when tracking changes in models so that we always have the same reference.\n\nA `ViewModel` provides functionality to easily consume the built in data package types\n{@link Ext.data.Model} and {@link Ext.data.Store}, as well as their associations.\n\n### Model Links\n\nA model can be described declaratively using {@link #cfg!links #links}. In the example code below,\nWe ask the `ViewModel` to construct a record of type `User` with `id: 17`. The model will be loaded\nfrom the server and the bindings will trigger once the load has completed. Similarly, we could also\nattach a model instance to the `ViewModel` data directly.\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.model.User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['name']\n    });\n\n    var rec = new MyApp.model.User({\n        id: 12,\n        name: 'Foo'\n    });\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        links: {\n            theUser: {\n                type: 'User',\n                id: 17\n            }\n        },\n        data: {\n            otherUser: rec\n        }\n    });\n    viewModel.bind('{theUser.name}', function(v) {\n        console.log(v);\n    });\n    viewModel.bind('{otherUser.name}', function(v) {\n        console.log(v);\n    });\n\n### Model Fields\n\nBindings have the functionality to inspect the parent values and resolve the underlying\nvalue dynamically. This behavior allows model fields to be interrogated as part of a binding.\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.model.User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['name', 'age']\n    });\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        links: {\n            theUser: {\n                type: 'User',\n                id: 22\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    // Server responds with:\n    {\n        \"id\": 22,\n        \"name\": \"Foo\",\n        \"age\": 100\n    }\n\n    viewModel.bind('Hello {name}, you are {age} years old', function(v) {\n        console.log(v);\n    });\n\n### Associations\n\nIn the same way as fields, the bindings can also traverse associations in a bind statement.\nThe `ViewModel` will handle the asynchronous loading of data and only present the value once\nthe full path has been loaded. For more information on associations see {@link Ext.data.schema.OneToOne} and\n{@link Ext.data.schema.ManyToOne} associations.\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['name']\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('Order', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['date', {\n            name: 'userId',\n            reference: 'User'\n        }]\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('OrderItem', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['price', 'qty', {\n            name: 'orderId',\n            reference: 'Order'\n        }]\n    });\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        links: {\n            orderItem: {\n                type: 'OrderItem',\n                id: 13\n            }\n        }\n    });\n    // The viewmodel will handle both ways of loading the data:\n    // a) If the data is loaded inline in a nested fashion it will\n    //    not make requests for extra data\n    // b) Only loading a single model at a time. So the Order will be loaded once\n    //    the OrderItem returns. The User will be loaded once the Order loads.\n    viewModel.bind('{orderItem.order.user.name}', function(name) {\n        console.log(name);\n    });\n\n### Stores\n\nStores can be created as part of the `ViewModel` definition. The definitions are processed\nlike bindings which allows for very powerful dynamic functionality.\n\nIt is important to ensure that you name viewModel's data keys uniquely. If data is not named\nuniquely, binds and formulas may receive information from an unintended data source.\nThis applies to keys in the viewModel's data block, stores, and links configs.\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        stores: {\n            users: {\n                model: 'User',\n                autoLoad: true,\n                filters: [{\n                    property: 'createdDate',\n                    value: '{createdFilter}',\n                    operator: '>'\n                }]\n            }\n        }\n    });\n    // Later on in our code, we set the date so that the store is created.\n    viewModel.set('createdFilter', Ext.Date.subtract(new Date(), Ext.Date.DAY, 7));\n\nSee {@link #cfg!stores #stores} for more detail.\n\n#### Formulas\n\nFormulas allow for calculated `ViewModel` data values. The dependencies for these formulas\nare automatically determined so that the formula will not be processed until the required\ndata is present.\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        formulas: {\n            fullName: function(get) {\n                return get('firstName') + ' ' + get('lastName');\n            }\n        },\n        data: {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Smith'}\n    });\n\n    viewModel.bind('{fullName}', function(v) {\n        console.log(v);\n    });\n\nSee {@link #cfg!formulas #formulas} for more detail.\n",

You must use the {@link #method!play #method-play},\n{@link #method!pause #method-pause}, and {@link #method!toggle #toggle} methods to control the audio (example below).\n\n## Examples\n\nThis example shows the use of the {@link Ext.Audio} component in a fullscreen container--change\nthe url: item for the location of an audio file--note that the audio starts on page load:\n\n    @example preview\n    Ext.create('Ext.Container', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        layout: {\n            type : 'vbox',\n            pack : 'center',\n            align: 'stretch'\n        },\n        items: [\n            {\n                xtype : 'toolbar',\n                docked: 'top',\n                title : 'Ext.Audio'\n            },\n            {\n                xtype: 'audio',\n                url  : 'touch-build/examples/audio/crash.mp3'\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n\nYou can also set the {@link #cfg!hidden #hidden} configuration of the {@link Ext.Audio} component to true by default,\nand then control the audio by using the {@link #method!play #method-play}, {@link #method!pause #method-pause}, and {@link #method!toggle #toggle} methods:\n\n    @example preview\n    Ext.create('Ext.Container', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        layout: {\n            type: 'vbox',\n            pack: 'center'\n        },\n        items: [\n            {\n                xtype : 'toolbar',\n                docked: 'top',\n                title : 'Ext.Audio'\n            },\n            {\n                xtype: 'toolbar',\n                docked: 'bottom',\n                defaults: {\n                    xtype: 'button',\n                    handler: function() {\n                        var container = this.getParent().getParent(),\n                            // use ComponentQuery to get the audio component (using its xtype)\n                            audio = container.down('audio');\n\n                        audio.toggle();\n                        this.setText(audio.isPlaying() ?

There are various\ndifferent styles of Button you can create by using the {@link #cfg!icon #icon}, {@link #cfg!iconCls #iconCls},\n{@link #cfg!iconAlign #iconAlign}, {@link #cfg!ui #ui}, and {@link #cfg!text #text} configurations.\n\n## Simple Button\n\nHere is a Button in it's simplest form:\n\n    @example miniphone\n    var button = Ext.create('Ext.Button', {\n        text: 'Button'\n    });\n    Ext.Viewport.add({ xtype: 'container', padding: 10, items: [button] });\n\n## Icons\n\nYou can also create a Button with just an icon using the {@link #cfg!iconCls #iconCls} configuration:\n\n    @example miniphone\n    var button = Ext.create('Ext.Button', {\n        iconCls: 'refresh'\n    });\n    Ext.Viewport.add({ xtype: 'container', padding: 10, items: [button] });\n\nSencha provides the \"Font\" and \"PNG\" icons packs from http://wwww.pictos.cc.\nUse icons with the {@link Global_CSS#sass-mixin!icon icon} mixin in your Sass.\n\n## Badges\n\nButtons can also have a badge on them, by using the {@link #cfg!badgeText #badgeText} configuration:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.Container', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        padding: 10,\n        items: {\n            xtype: 'button',\n            text: 'My Button',\n            badgeText: '2'\n        }\n    });\n\n## UI\n\nButtons also come with a range of different default UIs. Here are the included UIs\navailable (if {@link #var!$include-button-uis $include-button-uis} is set to `true`):\n\n- **normal** - a basic gray button\n- **back** - a back button\n- **forward** - a forward button\n- **round** - a round button\n- **action** - shaded using the {@link Global_CSS#var!$active-color $active-color} (dark blue by default)\n- **decline** - shaded using the {@link Global_CSS#var!$alert-color $alert-color} (red by default)\n- **confirm** - shaded using the {@link Global_CSS#var!$confirm-color $confirm-color} (green by default)\n\nYou can also append `-round` to each of the last three UI's to give it a round shape:\n\n- **action-round**\n- **decline-round**\n- **confirm-round**\n\nAnd setting them is very simple:\n\n    var uiButton = Ext.create('Ext.Button', {\n        text: 'My Button',\n        ui: 'action'\n    });\n\nAnd how they look:\n\n    @example miniphone preview\n    Ext.create('Ext.Container', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        padding: 4,\n        defaults: {\n            xtype: 'button',\n            margin: 5\n        },\n        layout: {\n            type: 'vbox',\n            align: 'center'\n        },\n        items: [\n            { ui: 'normal', text: 'normal' },\n            { ui: 'round', text: 'round' },\n            { ui: 'action', text: 'action' },\n            { ui: 'decline', text: 'decline' },\n            { ui: 'confirm', text: 'confirm' }\n        ]\n    });\n\nNote that the default {@link #cfg!ui #ui} is **normal**.\n\nYou can also use the {@link #sass-mixin!sencha-button-ui sencha-button-ui} CSS Mixin to create your own UIs.\n\n## Example\n\nThis example shows a bunch of icons on the screen in two toolbars. When you click on the center\nbutton, it switches the {@link #cfg!iconCls #iconCls} on every button on the page.\n\n    @example preview\n    Ext.createWidget('container', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        layout: {\n            type: 'vbox',\n            pack:'center',\n            align: 'center'\n        },\n        items: [\n            {\n                xtype: 'button',\n                text: 'Change iconCls',\n                handler: function() {\n                    // classes for all the icons to loop through.\n                    var availableIconCls = [\n                        'action', 'add', 'arrow_down', 'arrow_left',\n                        'arrow_right', 'arrow_up', 'compose', 'delete',\n                        'organize', 'refresh', 'reply', 'search',\n                        'settings', 'star', 'trash', 'maps', 'locate',\n                        'home'\n                    ];\n                    // get the text of this button,\n                    // so we know which button we don't want to change\n                    var text = this.getText();\n\n                    // use ComponentQuery to find all buttons on the page\n                    // and loop through all of them\n                    Ext.Array.forEach(Ext.ComponentQuery.query('button'), function(button) {\n                        // if the button is the change iconCls button, continue\n                        if (button.getText() === text) {\n                            return;\n                        }\n\n                        // get the index of the new available iconCls\n                        var index = availableIconCls.indexOf(button.getIconCls()) + 1;\n\n                        // update the iconCls of the button with the next iconCls, if one exists.\n                        // if not, use the first one\n                        button.setIconCls(availableIconCls[(index === availableIconCls.length) ? 0 : index]);\n                    });\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                xtype: 'toolbar',\n                docked: 'top',\n                items: [\n                    { xtype: 'spacer' },\n                    { iconCls: 'action' },\n                    { iconCls: 'add' },\n                    { iconCls: 'arrow_down' },\n                    { iconCls: 'arrow_left' },\n                    { iconCls: 'arrow_up' },\n                    { iconCls: 'compose' },\n                    { iconCls: 'delete' },\n                    { iconCls: 'organize' },\n                    { iconCls: 'refresh' },\n                    { xtype: 'spacer' }\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                xtype: 'toolbar',\n                docked: 'bottom',\n                ui: 'light',\n                items: [\n                    { xtype: 'spacer' },\n                    { iconCls: 'reply' },\n                    { iconCls: 'search' },\n                    { iconCls: 'settings' },\n                    { iconCls: 'star' },\n                    { iconCls: 'trash' },\n                    { iconCls: 'maps' },\n                    { iconCls: 'locate' },\n                    { iconCls: 'home' },\n                    { xtype: 'spacer' }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n",

Accepted keys are:\n\n- `panX`\n- `panY`\n- `pinchZoom`\n- `doubleTapZoom`\n\nAll touch actions are enabled (`true`) by default, so it is usually only necessary\nto specify which touch actions to disable.  For example, the following disables\nonly horizontal scrolling and pinch-to-zoom on the component's main element:\n\n    touchAction: {\n        panX: false,\n        pinchZoom: false\n    }\n\nTouch actions can be specified on reference elements using the reference element\nname, for example:\n\n    // disables horizontal scrolling on the main element, and double-tap-zoom\n    // on the child element named \"body\"\n    touchAction: {\n        panY: false\n        body: {\n            doubleTapZoom: false\n        }\n    }\n\nThe primary motivation for setting the touch-action of an element is to prevent\nthe browser's default handling of a gesture such as pinch-to-zoom, or\ndrag-to-scroll, so that the application can implement its own handling of that\ngesture on the element.  Suppose, for example, a component has a custom drag\nhandler on its element and wishes to prevent horizontal scrolling of its container\nwhile it is being dragged:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.Widget', {\n        touchAction: {\n            panX: false\n        },\n        listeners: {\n            drag: function(e) {\n                // implement drag logic\n            }\n        }\n    });\n",

A different timezone offset can be specified using the view's\n{@link Ext.calendar.view.Base#cfg!timezoneOffset timezoneOffset} config option.\n\n### Sample Response\n\nBelow is a sample response from a remote source providing a single event for a source\ncalendar with an id of 1:\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1001,\n        \"calendarId\": 1,\n        \"startDate\": \"2016-09-30T21:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"endDate\": \"2016-09-30T22:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"title\": \"Watch cartoons\",\n        \"description\": \"Catch up with adventurers Finn and Jake\"\n    }]\n\nSample response for the same source calendar with an all day event on Sept. 30th 2016\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1001,\n        \"calendarId\": 1,\n        \"startDate\": \"2016-09-30T00:00:00.000Z\",\n        \"endDate\": \"2016-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n        \"allDay\": true,\n        \"title\": \"Netflix Binge\",\n        \"description\": \"Watch Luke Cage.  Maybe twice.\"\n    }]\n\n**Note:** The \"id\"s for all events must be unique within a calendar store across all\nevent stores.  Duplicate \"id\"s even across event stores may result in unintended\nconsequences.\n\n### Custom Data\n\nWhile the Event model fields may not be set on a user-defined model, custom data can\neasily be accommodated by extending the Event model and modifying the associated\ngetter / setter methods.\n\nFor example, let's assume your events server provides the `description` as \"desc\".\nThe response from the server would look like:\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1001,\n        \"calendarId\": 1,\n        \"startDate\": \"2016-09-30T21:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"endDate\": \"2016-09-30T22:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"title\": \"Demo starter app\",\n        \"desc\": \"Demonstrate the starter app to project management\"\n    }]\n\nInternally what is used to read and write the description is `{@link #method!getDescription getDescription}` and\n`{@link #method!setDescription setDescription}`.  By default those will be looking for the description string to be\non the `description` field.  To have our model work with the `desc` data instead the\nderived model would look like:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.model.Event', {\n        extend: 'Ext.calendar.model.Event',\n\n        getDescription: function () {\n            return this.data.desc;\n        },\n        setDescription: function (description) {\n            this.set('desc', description);\n        }\n    });\n\nThe model can then be specified on the Events store config:\n\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'calendar',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        height: 400,\n        width: 600,\n        store: {\n            autoLoad: true,\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'ajax',\n                url: 'calendars.php'\n            },\n            eventStoreDefaults: {\n                model: 'MyApp.model.Event',\n                proxy: {\n                    type: 'ajax',\n                    url: 'events.php'\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nThe calendar makes no assumptions about the structure of the data provided, only that\nit exists. This abstraction of data access ensures flexibility for a wide range of\ndata structures to be used.\n\nAs an example of this concept, the default Event model has a `startDate` and `endDate`\nfield. The {@link #method!getDuration #method-getDuration} method is calculated based on these values.\nAnother possible implementation could be to have a `startDate` and `duration` field on\nthe model and have the `{@link #method!getEndDate getEndDate}` be a calculated quantity. The API makes no\ndistinction here, as long as the EventBase interface is fulfilled.\n",

A target date can be specified\nby setting the {@link #cfg-value} config option.\n\n### Sample View\n\nBelow is a sample view instance.  The following example shows how to create a day view,\nbut the basic configuration applies to all view subclasses with the exception of the\nxtype used.\n\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'calendar-day',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        height: 400,\n        width: 400,\n        store: {\n            autoLoad: true,\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'ajax',\n                url: 'calendars.php'\n            },\n            eventStoreDefaults: {\n                proxy: {\n                    type: 'ajax',\n                    url: 'events.php'\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nConfigurations for the view can be specified directly on the panel:\n\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'calendar-day',\n        height: 500,\n        height: 500,\n        resizeEvents: false,\n        startTime: 8,\n        endTime: 16,\n        store: {\n            autoLoad: true,\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'ajax',\n                url: 'calendars.php'\n            },\n            eventStoreDefaults: {\n                proxy: {\n                    type: 'ajax',\n                    url: 'events.php'\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        listeners: {\n            eventdrop: function() {\n                console.log('Dropped');\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n**Note:** For more information on possible store configurations and the expected\nserver response for both Calendars and Events stores see:\n{@link Ext.calendar.store.Calendars}.\n\n### In-View Calendar Events\n\nEvents show on the view timeline with their start and end times correlating to either\nthe date or the time slots depending on the view type.  The events will display on the\ntimeline according to your local timezone offset from GMT (the expected format for\nstart / end times for events is UTC).  The timezone offset can be applied explicitly\nusing the {@link #cfg-timezoneOffset} config option.  If the view has multiple source\ncalendars, their events will attempt to share overlapping space within their\ncorresponding date / time slots.  Events will be displayed as a different color for\neach source calendar and their appearance will vary slightly depending on their\n{@link Ext.calendar.Event.html#cfg-mode mode}.  The overlapping behavior of events\ncompeting for the same time slot can be managed using the {@link #cfg-displayOverlap}\nconfig option.\n\n### Adding / Editing Events\n\nEvents may be added to the view by dragging / swiping across the timeline to create\nthe event endpoints.  Doing so shows the {@link Ext.calendar.form.Add}\nwith the dates / times pre-populated from the drag selection.  The\n{@link #cfg-allowSelection} config can be set to false to prevent user from creating\nevents in this way.  Events added programmatically by calling the\n{@link #method!showAddForm #method-showAddForm} method to present the add input form.  Set the view's\n{@link #cfg-addForm} config to `null` to prevent events from being added to the\ncalendar.\n\nDouble clicking / tapping an event within the view shows the\n{@link Ext.calendar.form.Edit} allowing events to be edited by users.\nThe add form and edit form can be configured using the view's {@link #cfg-addForm} and\n{@link #cfg-editForm} configs.  For views with time displayed on the y axis of the\nview (Day, Days, and Week), existing events can be resized using the resize handle on\nthe event widget as well as dragged across the view.  The {@link #cfg-resizeEvents},\n{@link #cfg!draggable #cfg-draggable}, and {@link #cfg-droppable} configs may be used to manage event\ninteractions.\n\n### View Navigation\n\nThe calendar view does not create controls for navigating the view's date range,\nhowever the view can be navigated programmatically.  The view's target date can be set\nexplicitly using the {@link #method-setValue} method.  The\n{@link #method!movePrevious #method-movePrevious} and {@link #method!moveNext #method-moveNext} methods may be called to\nmove the displayed date range forward or back.  And the {@link #method!navigate #method-navigate} lets\nyou move the date an arbitrary amount relative to the current date {@link #cfg-value}.\n\n### Compact Mode\nThe base view class has a {@link #cfg-compact} config.  This boolean configures\nwhether or not the view is in compact mode.  It’s expected that this will be used as a\nplatform config or a responsive config.  Setting compact mode by itself does not\nmodify how the view displays.  What it does do is apply the\n{@link #cfg-compactOptions} config over the top over the current configuration\noptions.  These `{@link #property!compactOptions compactOptions}` are what is used to specify what compactness means\nfor a particular view.  Check out the `{@link #property!compactOptions compactOptions}` for each calendar view type to\nsee its default `{@link #property!compactOptions compactOptions}`.\n",

Loading the\nCalendars store and its source calendars will automatically fetch events for the\ncalendar view's date range.  However, by default the Events store belonging to each\nsource calendar is not configured with a {@link Ext.data.proxy.Server} to fetch\nthe remote events.  Using the above example the expected data response for a single\nsource calendar would look something like:\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"Personal\",\n        \"eventStore\": {\n            \"proxy\": {\n                \"type\": \"ajax\",\n                \"url\": \"events.php\"\n            }\n        }\n    }]\n\nIn the above data response we see:\n\n - **id** - The unique id for this source calendar record in the Calendars store\n - **title** - The source calendar title (used when displayed in a\n{@link Ext.calendar.form.CalendarPicker})\n - **eventStore** - The config options for the source calendar Events store\n\n**Note:** for more information on the data the Calendar model consumes refer to\n{@link Ext.calendar.model.Calendar}\n\n### Default Events Store Configuration\n\nPassing the `eventStore` config back with the calendar offers maximum flexibility as\nthe Events store config / url can be specified uniquely per source calendar.  However,\nif the events will all be served up from the same remote source it may be more\neffective to configure the Calendars store's {@link #cfg!eventStoreDefaults #cfg-eventStoreDefaults} with\ncommon defaults.  As an example:\n\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'calendar',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        height: 400,\n        width: 600,\n        store: {\n            autoLoad: true,\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'ajax',\n                url: 'calendars.php'\n            },\n            eventStoreDefaults: {\n                proxy: {\n                    type: 'ajax',\n                    url: 'events.php'\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nWith the above configuration a sample response from \"calendars.php\" including a single\nsource calendar would be:\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"Personal\"\n    }]\n\nUsing the above Calendars config every source calendar passed back from\n\"calendars.php\" will have its events store configured to fetch events from\n\"events.php\".  Read operations requesting events will pass up to the remote server:\n\n - **calendar** - The id of the source calendar\n - **startDate** - The start date / time of events for the current calendar view\n - **endDate** - The end date / time of events for the current calendar view\n\nYou can configure the param names sent using the Event model's\n{@link Ext.calendar.store.Events#cfg!calendarParam calendarParam},\n{@link Ext.calendar.store.Events#cfg!startParam startParam}, and\n{{@link Ext.calendar.store.Events#cfg!endParam endParam}} config options.\n\n**Note:** The date range requested will be somewhat larger than the current visible\ndate range in the calendar view as set in the Events store's\n{@link Ext.calendar.store.Events#cfg!prefetchMode prefetchMode} config option.\nCommonly this configuration can be left as its default.\n\n### Events Response\n\nBelow is a sample response from 'events.php' for a 1 hour event.\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1001,\n        \"calendarId\": 1,\n        \"startDate\": \"2016-09-30T21:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"endDate\": \"2016-09-30T22:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"title\": \"Watch cartoons\",\n        \"description\": \"Catch up with adventurers Finn and Jake\"\n    }]\n\nSample response from 'events.php' for an all day event on Sept. 30th 2016\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1001,\n        \"calendarId\": 1,\n        \"startDate\": \"2016-09-30T00:00:00.000Z\",\n        \"endDate\": \"2016-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n        \"allDay\": true,\n        \"title\": \"Netflix Binge\",\n        \"description\": \"Watch Luke Cage.  Maybe twice.\"\n    }]\n\nAn all day event should be indicated as `allDay`: true.  Its `startDate` will be the\n00:00:00 hour of the target date and have an `endDate` with a 00:00:00 time on the\nfollowing day.\n\nIn the event response we see:\n\n - **id** - The unique id for the calendar event record\n - **calendarId** - The id of the parent source calendar\n - **startDate** - The event's start date and time (in UTC format)\n - **endDate** - The event's end date and time (in UTC format)\n - **title** - The title to display for the event\n - **description** - The description to display for the event\n\n**Note:** for more information on the data the Events model consumes refer to\n{@link Ext.calendar.model.Event}\n\n### Multi-Calendar Support\n\nThe calendar views also accommodate multiple source calendars within the same view.\nThe response from the Calendars store (from 'calendars.php' using the above example)\nshould be an array of objects containing a unique \"id\" per source calendar along with\nunique \"title\"s.  The titles will display in a combo field in the add/edit event forms\nas a way to indicate what source calendar an event belongs to as well as in the\n{@link Ext.calendar.panel.Panel}\n{@link Ext.calendar.List}.  The id will correlate to the \"calendarId\"\nkey in the event response.\n\nSample response from 'calendars.php' including two source calendars: \"Personal\" and\n\"Work\"\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"Personal\"\n    }, {\n        \"id\": 2,\n        \"title\": \"Work\"\n    }]\n\nA view with two source calendars will make two read request each time the view's date\nrange is rendered.  Expected in return is two separate responses containing events\nwith \"calendarId\" keys corresponding to the calendar that owns the events.  With a\ncalendar view with both \"Personal\" and \"Work\" source calendars two responses would be\nexpected: one like as seen above including a key of `\"calendarId\": 1` and one for the\nWork calendar as seen here.\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 2001,\n        \"calendarId\": 2,\n        \"startDate\": \"2016-09-30T21:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"endDate\": \"2016-09-30T22:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"title\": \"Meet with Development\",\n        \"description\": \"Discuss the current cycle requirements\"\n    }]\n\n**Note:** The \"id\"s for all events must be unique within a calendar store across all\nevent stores.  Duplicate \"id\"s even across event stores may result in unintended\nconsequences.\n",

Calendar views display events for a date /\ntime range specified by the view subclasses:\n\n- {@link Ext.calendar.view.Day}\n- {@link Ext.calendar.view.Days}\n- {@link Ext.calendar.view.Week}\n- {@link Ext.calendar.view.Weeks}\n- {@link Ext.calendar.view.Month}\n- {@link Ext.calendar.view.Multi}\n\nBy default, the view will display the current date along with any other dates surround\nthat date as specified by the particular view type.  A target date can be specified\nby setting the {@link #cfg!value #cfg-value} config option.\n\n### Sample View\n\nBelow is a sample view instance.  The following example shows how to create a day view,\nbut the basic configuration applies to all view subclasses with the exception of the\nxtype used.\n\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'calendar-dayview',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        height: 400,\n        width: 400,\n        store: {\n            autoLoad: true,\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'ajax',\n                url: 'calendars.php'\n            },\n            eventStoreDefaults: {\n                proxy: {\n                    type: 'ajax',\n                    url: 'events.php'\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n**Note:** For more information on possible store configurations and the expected\nserver response for both Calendars and Events stores see:\n{@link Ext.calendar.store.Calendars}.\n\n### In-View Calendar Events\n\nEvents show on the view timeline with their start and end times correlating to either\nthe date or the time slots depending on the view type.  The events will display on the\ntimeline according to your local timezone offset from GMT (the expected format for\nstart / end times for events is UTC).  The timezone offset can be applied explicitly\nusing the {@link #cfg!timezoneOffset #cfg-timezoneOffset} config option.  If the view has multiple source\ncalendars, their events will attempt to share overlapping space within their\ncorresponding date / time slots.  Events will be displayed as a different color for\neach source calendar and their appearance will vary slightly depending on their\n{@link Ext.calendar.Event.html#cfg-mode mode}.  The overlapping behavior of events\ncompeting for the same time slot can be managed using the {@link #cfg-displayOverlap}\nconfig option.\n\n### Adding / Editing Events\n\nEvents may be added to the view by dragging / swiping across the timeline to create\nthe event endpoints.  Doing so shows the {@link Ext.calendar.form.Add}\nwith the dates / times pre-populated from the drag selection.  The\n{@link #cfg-allowSelection} config can be set to false to prevent user from creating\nevents in this way.  Events added programmatically by calling the\n{@link #method!showAddForm #method-showAddForm} method to present the add input form.  Set the view's\n{@link #cfg!addForm #cfg-addForm} config to `null` to prevent events from being added to the\ncalendar.\n\nDouble clicking / tapping an event within the view shows the\n{@link Ext.calendar.form.Edit} allowing events to be edited by users.\nThe add form and edit form can be configured using the view's {@link #cfg!addForm #cfg-addForm} and\n{@link #cfg!editForm #cfg-editForm} configs.  For views with time displayed on the y axis of the\nview (Day, Days, and Week), existing events can be resized using the resize handle on\nthe event widget as well as dragged across the view.  The {@link #cfg-resizeEvents},\n{@link #cfg!draggable #cfg-draggable}, and {@link #cfg-droppable} configs may be used to manage event\ninteractions.\n\n### View Navigation\n\nThe calendar view does not create controls for navigating the view's date range,\nhowever the view can be navigated programmatically.  The view's target date can be set\nexplicitly using the {@link #method-setValue} method.  The\n{@link #method!movePrevious #method-movePrevious} and {@link #method!moveNext #method-moveNext} methods may be called to\nmove the displayed date range forward or back.  And the {@link #method!navigate #method-navigate} lets\nyou move the date an arbitrary amount relative to the current date {@link #cfg!value #cfg-value}.\n\n### Compact Mode\nThe base view class has a {@link #cfg!compact #cfg-compact} config.  This boolean configures\nwhether or not the view is in compact mode.  It’s expected that this will be used as a\nplatform config or a responsive config.  Setting compact mode by itself does not\nmodify how the view displays.  What it does do is apply the\n{@link #cfg!compactOptions #cfg-compactOptions} config over the top over the current configuration\noptions.  These `{@link #cfg!compactOptions compactOptions}` are what is used to specify what compactness means\nfor a particular view.  Check out the `{@link #cfg!compactOptions compactOptions}` for each calendar view type to\nsee its default `{@link #cfg!compactOptions compactOptions}`.\n",

A chart instance example could look like this:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.chart.CartesianChart', {\n        width: 800,\n        height: 600,\n        animation: {\n            easing: 'backOut',\n            duration: 500\n        },\n        store: store1,\n        legend: {\n            position: 'right'\n        },\n        axes: [\n            // ...some axes options...\n        ],\n        series: [\n            // ...some series options...\n        ]\n    });\n\nIn this example we set the `{@link #cfg!width width}` and `{@link #cfg!height height}` of a chart; We decide whether our series are\nanimated or not and we select a store to be bound to the chart; We also set the legend to the right part of the\nchart.\n\nYou can register certain interactions such as {@link Ext.chart.interactions.PanZoom} on the chart by specify an\narray of names or more specific config objects. All the events will be wired automatically.\n\nYou can also listen to series `itemXXX` events on both chart and series level.\n\nFor example:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.chart.CartesianChart', {\n        plugins: {\n            ptype: 'chartitemevents',\n            moveEvents: true\n        },\n        store: {\n            fields: ['pet', 'households', 'total'],\n            data: [\n                {pet: 'Cats', households: 38, total: 93},\n                {pet: 'Dogs', households: 45, total: 79},\n                {pet: 'Fish', households: 13, total: 171}\n            ]\n        },\n        axes: [{\n            type: 'numeric',\n            position: 'left'\n        }, {\n            type: 'category',\n            position: 'bottom'\n        }],\n        series: [{\n            type: 'bar',\n            xField: 'pet',\n            yField: 'households',\n            listeners: {\n                itemmousemove: function (series, item, event) {\n                    console.log('itemmousemove', item.category, item.field);\n                }\n            }\n        }, {\n            type: 'line',\n            xField: 'pet',\n            yField: 'total',\n            marker: true\n        }],\n        listeners: { // Listen to itemclick events on all series.\n            itemclick: function (chart, item, event) {\n                console.log('itemclick', item.category, item.field);\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nFor more information about the axes and series configurations please check the documentation of\neach series (Line, Bar, Pie, etc).\n",

        "doc": "\nDefines axis for charts.\n\nUsing the current model, the type of axis can be easily extended. By default, Sencha Charts provide three different\ntypes of axis:\n\n * **numeric** - the data attached to this axis is numeric and continuous.\n * **time** - the data attached to this axis is (or gets converted into) a date/time value; it is continuous.\n * **category** - the data attached to this axis belongs to a finite set. The data points are evenly placed along the axis.\n\nThe behavior of an axis can be easily changed by setting different types of axis layout and axis segmenter to the axis.\n\nAxis layout defines how the data points are placed. Using continuous layout, the data points will be distributed by\nthe numeric value. Using discrete layout the data points will be spaced evenly. Furthermore, if you want to combine\nthe data points with the duplicate values in a discrete layout, you should use combineDuplicate layout.\n\nSegmenter defines the way to segment data range. For example, if you have a Date-type data range from Jan 1, 1997 to\nJan 1, 2017, the segmenter will segement the data range into years, months or days based on the current zooming\nlevel.\n\nIt is possible to write custom axis layouts and segmenters to extends this behavior by simply implementing interfaces\n{@link Ext.chart.axis.layout.Layout} and {@link Ext.chart.axis.segmenter.Segmenter}.\n\nHere's an example for the axes part of a chart definition:\nAn example of axis for a series (in this case for an area chart that has multiple layers of yFields) could be:\n\n    axes: [{\n        type: 'numeric',\n        position: 'left',\n        title: 'Number of Hits',\n        grid: {\n            odd: {\n                opacity: 1,\n                fill: '#ddd',\n                stroke: '#bbb',\n                lineWidth: 1\n            }\n        },\n        minimum: 0\n    }, {\n        type: 'category',\n        position: 'bottom',\n        title: 'Month of the Year',\n        grid: true,\n        label: {\n            rotate: {\n                degrees: 315\n            }\n        }\n    }]\n\nIn this case we use a `numeric` axis for displaying the values of the Area series and a `category` axis for displaying the names of\nthe store elements. The numeric axis is placed on the left of the screen, while the category axis is placed at the bottom of the chart.\nBoth the category and numeric axes have `{@link #cfg!grid grid}` set, which means that horizontal and vertical lines will cover the chart background. In the\ncategory axis the labels will be rotated so they can fit the space better.\n",

Otherwise the generated getter and setter\nmethods will not be initialized.\n\nEach config item will have its own setter and getter method automatically generated inside the class prototype\nduring class creation time, if the class does not have those methods explicitly defined.\n\nAs an example, let's convert the name property of a Person class to be a config item, then add extra age and\ngender items.\n\n    Ext.define('My.sample.Person', {\n        config: {\n            name: 'Mr. Unknown',\n            age: 0,\n            gender: 'Male'\n        },\n\n        constructor: function(config) {\n            this.initConfig(config);\n\n            return this;\n        }\n\n        // ...\n    });\n\nWithin the class, this.name still has the default value of \"Mr. Unknown\". However, it's now publicly accessible\nwithout sacrificing encapsulation, via setter and getter methods.\n\n    var jacky = new Person({\n        name: \"Jacky\",\n        age: 35\n    });\n\n    alert(jacky.getAge());      // alerts 35\n    alert(jacky.getGender());   // alerts \"Male\"\n\n    jacky.walk(10);             // alerts \"Jacky is walking 10 steps\"\n\n    jacky.setName(\"Mr. Nguyen\");\n    alert(jacky.getName());     // alerts \"Mr. Nguyen\"\n\n    jacky.walk(10);             // alerts \"Mr. Nguyen is walking 10 steps\"\n\nNotice that we changed the class constructor to invoke this.initConfig() and pass in the provided config object.\nTwo key things happened:\n\n - The provided config object when the class is instantiated is recursively merged with the default config object.\n - All corresponding setter methods are called with the merged values.\n\nBeside storing the given values, throughout the frameworks, setters generally have two key responsibilities:\n\n - Filtering / validation / transformation of the given value before it's actually stored within the instance.\n - Notification (such as firing events) / post-processing after the value has been set, or changed from a\n   previous value.\n\nBy standardize this common pattern, the default generated setters provide two extra template methods that you\ncan put your own custom logics into, i.e: an \"applyFoo\" and \"updateFoo\" method for a \"foo\" config item, which are\nexecuted before and after the value is actually set, respectively. Back to the example class, let's validate that\nage must be a valid positive number, and fire an 'agechange' if the value is modified.\n\n    Ext.define('My.sample.Person', {\n        config: {\n            // ...\n        },\n\n        constructor: {\n            // ...\n        },\n\n        applyAge: function(age) {\n            if (typeof age !== 'number' || age < 0) {\n                console.warn(\"Invalid age, must be a positive number\");\n                return;\n            }\n\n            return age;\n        },\n\n        updateAge: function(newAge, oldAge) {\n            // age has changed from \"oldAge\" to \"newAge\"\n            this.fireEvent('agechange', this, newAge, oldAge);\n        }\n\n        // ...\n    });\n\n    var jacky = new Person({\n        name: \"Jacky\",\n        age: 'invalid'\n    });\n\n    alert(jacky.getAge());      // alerts 0\n\n    alert(jacky.setAge(-100));  // alerts 0\n    alert(jacky.getAge());      // alerts 0\n\n    alert(jacky.setAge(35));    // alerts 0\n    alert(jacky.getAge());      // alerts 35\n\nIn other words, when leveraging the config feature, you mostly never need to define setter and getter methods\nexplicitly. Instead, \"apply*\" and \"update*\" methods should be implemented where necessary. Your code will be\nconsistent throughout and only contain the minimal logic that you actually care about.\n\nWhen it comes to inheritance, the default config of the parent class is automatically, recursively merged with\nthe child's default config. The same applies for mixins.\n"

With\nmany added Components, this approach could potentially slow the rendering of the page. In the second example,\nthe button will not be created or rendered until the panel is actually displayed in the browser. If the panel\nis never displayed (for example, if it is a tab that remains hidden) then the button will never be created and\nwill never consume any resources whatsoever.\n"

Otherwise you get same as \"removeMethod\".\n                     method: function () {\n                         // Do what v5 \"method\" did. If \"method\" exists in newer\n                         // versions callParent can call it. If 5.1 has \"method\"\n                         // then it would be next in line, otherwise 5.2 and last\n                         // would be the current class.\n                     },\n\n                     moreHelpful: {\n                         message: 'Something helpful to do instead.',\n                         fn: function () {\n                             // The v5 \"moreHelpful\" method to use when enabled.\n                         }\n                     }\n                 },\n                 properties: {\n                     // Throws: '\"removedProp\" is deprecated.'\n                     removedProp: null,\n\n                     // Throws: '\"oldProp\" is deprecated. Please use \"newProp\" instead.'\n                     oldProp: 'newProp',\n\n                     helpful: {\n                         message: 'Something helpful message about what to do.'\n                     }\n                     ...\n                 },\n                 statics: {\n                     methods: {\n                         ...\n                     },\n                     properties: {\n                         ...\n                     },\n                 }\n             },\n\n             '5.1': {\n                 ...\n             },\n\n             '5.2': {\n                 ...\n             }\n         }\n     });\n\nThe primary content of `{@link #cfg!deprecated deprecated}` are the version number keys. These indicate\na version number where methods or properties were deprecated. These versions are\ncompared to the version reported by `Ext.getCompatVersion` to determine the action\nto take for each \"block\".\n\nWhen the compatibility version is set to a value less than a version number key,\nthat block is said to be \"enabled\". For example, if a method was deprecated in\nversion 5.0 but the desired compatibility level is 4.2 then the block is used to\npatch methods and (to some degree) restore pre-5.0 compatibility.\n\nWhen multiple active blocks have the same method name, each method is applied as\nan override in reverse order of version. In the above example, if a method appears\nin the \"5.0\", \"5.1\" and \"5.2\" blocks then the \"5.2\" method is applied as an override\nfirst, followed by the \"5.1\" method and finally the \"5.0\" method. This means that\nthe `callParent` from the \"5.0\" method calls the \"5.1\" method which calls the\n\"5.2\" method which can (if applicable) call the current version.\n"

    "Ext.Component": {
        "type": "Ext.Component",
        "doc": "Most of the visual classes you interact with are Components. Every Component is a\nsubclass of Ext.Component, which means they can all:\n\n* Render themselves onto the page using a template\n* Show and hide themselves at any time\n* Center themselves within their parent container\n* Enable and disable themselves\n\nThey can also do a few more advanced things:\n\n* Float above other components (windows, message boxes and overlays)\n* Change size and position on the screen with animation\n* Dock other Components inside themselves (useful for toolbars)\n* Align to other components, allow themselves to be dragged around, make their content scrollable & more\n\n## Available Components\n\nThere are many components.  They are separated into 4 main groups:\n\n### Navigation components\n* {@link Ext.Toolbar}\n* {@link Ext.Button}\n* {@link Ext.TitleBar}\n* {@link Ext.SegmentedButton}\n* {@link Ext.Title}\n* {@link Ext.Spacer}\n\n### Store-bound components\n* {@link Ext.dataview.DataView}\n* {@link Ext.carousel.Carousel Ext.Carousel}\n* {@link Ext.dataview.List Ext.List}\n* {@link Ext.dataview.NestedList Ext.NestedList}\n\n### Form components\n* {@link Ext.form.Panel}\n* {@link Ext.form.FieldSet}\n* {@link Ext.field.Checkbox}\n* {@link Ext.field.Hidden}\n* {@link Ext.field.Slider}\n* {@link Ext.field.Text}\n* {@link Ext.picker.Picker}\n* {@link Ext.picker.Date}\n\n### General components\n* {@link Ext.Panel}\n* {@link Ext.tab.Panel}\n* {@link Ext.Viewport}\n* {@link Ext.Img}\n* {@link Ext.Audio}\n* {@link Ext.Video}\n* {@link Ext.Sheet}\n* {@link Ext.ActionSheet}\n* {@link Ext.MessageBox}\n\n\n## Instantiating Components\n\nComponents are created the same way as all other classes - using Ext.create. Here's how we can\ncreate a Text field:\n\n    var panel = Ext.create('Ext.Panel', {\n        html: 'This is my panel'\n    });\n\nThis will create a {@link Ext.Panel} instance, configured with some basic HTML content. A Panel is just a\nsimple Component that can render HTML and also contain other items. In this case we've created a Panel instance but\nit won't show up on the screen yet because items are not rendered immediately after being instantiated. This allows\nus to create some components and move them around before rendering and laying them out, which is a good deal faster\nthan moving them after rendering.\n\nTo show this panel on the screen now we can simply add it to the global Viewport:\n\n    Ext.Viewport.add(panel);\n\nPanels are also Containers, which means they can contain other Components, arranged by a layout. Let's revisit the\nabove example now, this time creating a panel with two child Components and a hbox layout:\n\n    @example\n    var panel = Ext.create('Ext.Panel', {\n        layout: 'hbox',\n\n        items: [\n            {\n                xtype: 'panel',\n                flex: 1,\n                html: 'Left Panel, 1/3rd of total size',\n                 style: 'background-color: #5E99CC;'\n            },\n            {\n                xtype: 'panel',\n                flex: 2,\n                html: 'Right Panel, 2/3rds of total size',\n                 style: 'background-color: #759E60;'\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n\n    Ext.Viewport.add(panel);\n\nThis time we created 3 Panels - the first one is created just as before but the inner two are declared inline using\nan xtype. Xtype is a convenient way of creating Components without having to go through the process of using\nExt.create and specifying the full class name, instead you can just provide the xtype for the class inside an object\nand the framework will create the components for you.\n\nWe also specified a layout for the top level panel - in this case hbox, which splits the horizontal width of the\nparent panel based on the 'flex' of each child. For example, if the parent Panel above is 300px wide then the first\nchild will be flexed to 100px wide and the second to 200px because the first one was given `flex: 1` and the second\n`flex: 2`.\n\n## Using xtype\n\nxtype is an easy way to create Components without using the full class name. This is especially useful when creating\na {@link Ext.Container} that contains child Components. An xtype is simply a shorthand way of specifying a\nComponent - for example you can use `xtype: 'panel'` instead of typing out Ext.panel.Panel.\n\nSample usage:\n\n    @example miniphone\n    Ext.create('Ext.Container', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        layout: 'fit',\n\n        items: [\n            {\n                xtype: 'panel',\n                html: 'This panel is created by xtype'\n            },\n            {\n                xtype: 'toolbar',\n                title: 'So is the toolbar',\n                docked: 'top'\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n\n\n### Common xtypes\n\n<pre>\nxtype                   Class\n-----------------       ---------------------\nactionsheet             Ext.ActionSheet\naudio                   Ext.Audio\nbutton                  Ext.Button\nimage                   Ext.Img\nlabel                   Ext.Label\nloadmask                Ext.LoadMask\npanel                   Ext.Panel\nsegmentedbutton         Ext.SegmentedButton\nsheet                   Ext.Sheet\nspacer                  Ext.Spacer\ntitlebar                Ext.TitleBar\ntoolbar                 Ext.Toolbar\nvideo                   Ext.Video\ncarousel                Ext.carousel.Carousel\nnavigationview          Ext.navigation.View\ndatepicker              Ext.picker.Date\npicker                  Ext.picker.Picker\nslider                  Ext.slider.Slider\nthumb                   Ext.slider.Thumb\ntabpanel                Ext.tab.Panel\nviewport                Ext.viewport.Default\n\nDataView Components\n---------------------------------------------\ndataview                Ext.dataview.DataView\nlist                    Ext.dataview.List\nnestedlist              Ext.dataview.NestedList\n\nForm Components\n---------------------------------------------\ncheckboxfield           Ext.field.Checkbox\ndatepickerfield         Ext.field.DatePicker\nemailfield              Ext.field.Email\nhiddenfield             Ext.field.Hidden\nnumberfield             Ext.field.Number\npasswordfield           Ext.field.Password\nradiofield              Ext.field.Radio\nsearchfield             Ext.field.Search\nselectfield             Ext.field.Select\nsliderfield             Ext.field.Slider\nspinnerfield            Ext.field.Spinner\ntextfield               Ext.field.Text\ntextareafield           Ext.field.TextArea\ntogglefield             Ext.field.Toggle\nurlfield                Ext.field.Url\nfieldset                Ext.form.FieldSet\nformpanel               Ext.form.Panel\n</pre>\n\n## Configuring Components\n\nWhenever you create a new Component you can pass in configuration options. All of the configurations for a given\nComponent are listed in the \"Config options\" section of its class docs page. You can pass in any number of\nconfiguration options when you instantiate the Component, and modify any of them at any point later. For example, we\ncan easily modify the {@link Ext.Panel#cfg!html html content} of a Panel after creating it:\n\n    @example miniphone\n    // we can configure the HTML when we instantiate the Component\n    var panel = Ext.create('Ext.Panel', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        html: 'This is a Panel'\n    });\n\n    // we can update the HTML later using the setHtml method:\n    panel.setHtml('Some new HTML');\n\n    // we can retrieve the current HTML using the getHtml method:\n    Ext.Msg.alert(panel.getHtml()); // displays \"Some new HTML\"\n\nEvery config has a getter method and a setter method - these are automatically generated and always follow the same\npattern. For example, a config called `{@link #cfg!html html}` will receive `getHtml` and `setHtml` methods, a config called `defaultType`\nwill receive `getDefaultType` and `setDefaultType` methods, and so on.\n",

For example, the component `Ext.button.Button` has an xtype of `button`.\n\nYou can define your own xtype on a custom {@link Ext.Component} by specifying the\n{@link Ext.Class#cfg!alias alias} config option with a prefix of `widget`. For example:\n\n    Ext.define('PressMeButton', {\n        extend: 'Ext.button.Button',\n        alias: 'widget.pressmebutton',\n        text: 'Press Me'\n    });\n\nAny Component can be created implicitly as an object config with an xtype specified, allowing it to be\ndeclared and passed into the rendering pipeline without actually being instantiated as an object. Not only is\nrendering deferred, but the actual creation of the object itself is also deferred, saving memory and resources\nuntil they are actually needed. In complex, nested layouts containing many Components, this can make a\nnoticeable improvement in performance.\n\n    // Explicit creation of contained Components:\n    var panel = new Ext.Panel({\n       // ...\n       items: [\n          Ext.create('Ext.button.Button', {\n             text: 'OK'\n          })\n       ]\n    });\n\n    // Implicit creation using xtype:\n    var panel = new Ext.Panel({\n       // ...\n       items: [{\n          xtype: 'button',\n          text: 'OK'\n       }]\n    });\n\nIn the first example, the button will always be created immediately during the panel's initialization. With\nmany added Components, this approach could potentially slow the rendering of the page. In the second example,\nthe button will not be created or rendered until the panel is actually displayed in the browser. If the panel\nis never displayed (for example, if it is a tab that remains hidden) then the button will never be created and\nwill never consume any resources whatsoever.\n"

There are several\nrelationship operators, mostly taken from CSS selectors:\n\n- **`E F`** All descendant Components of E that match F\n- **`E > F`** All direct children Components of E that match F\n- **`E ^ F`** All parent Components of E that match F\n\nExpressions between relationship operators are matched left to right, i.e. leftmost\nselector is applied first, then if one or more matches are found, relationship operator\nitself is applied, then next selector expression, etc. It is possible to combine\nrelationship operators in complex selectors:\n\n    window[title=\"Input form\"] textfield[name=login] ^ form > button[action=submit]\n\nThat selector can be read this way: Find a window with title \"Input form\", in that\nwindow find a TextField with name \"login\" at any depth (including subpanels and/or\nFieldSets), then find an `{@link Ext.form.Panel}` that is a parent of the TextField, and in\nthat form find a direct child that is a button with custom property `action` set to\nvalue \"submit\".\n\nWhitespace on both sides of `^` and `>` operators is non-significant, i.e. can be\nomitted, but usually is used for clarity.\n\n## Searching by Component attributes\n\nComponents can be searched by their object property values (attributes). To do that,\nuse attribute matching expression in square brackets:\n\n- `component[disabled]` - matches any Component that has `disabled` property with\nany truthy (non-empty, not `false`) value.\n- `panel[title=\"Test\"]` - matches any Component that has `title` property set to\n\"Test\". Note that if the value does not contain spaces, the quotes are optional.\n\nAttributes can use any of the following operators to compare values:\n`=`, `!=`, `^=`, `$=`, `*=`, `%=`, `|=` and `~=`.\n\nPrefixing the attribute name with an at sign `@` means that the property must be\nthe object's `ownProperty`, not a property from the prototype chain.\n\nSpecifications like `[propName]` check that the property is a truthy value. To check\nthat the object has an `ownProperty` of a certain name, regardless of the value use\nthe form `[?propName]`.\n\nThe specified value is coerced to match the type of the property found in the\ncandidate Component using {@link Ext#method!coerce Ext#coerce}.\n\nIf you need to find Components by their `itemId` property, use the `#id` form; it will\ndo the same as `[itemId=id]` but is easier to read.\n\nIf you need to include a metacharacter like (, ), [, ], etc., in the query, escape it\nby prefixing it with a backslash:\n\n     var component = Ext.ComponentQuery.query('[myProperty=\\\\[foo\\\\]]');\n\n## Attribute matching operators\n\nThe '=' operator will return the results that **exactly** match the\nspecified object property (attribute):\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel[cls=my-cls]');\n\nWill match the following Component:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.window.Window', {\n        cls: 'my-cls'\n    });\n\nBut will not match the following Component, because 'my-cls' is one value\namong others:\n\n     Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', {\n         cls: 'foo-cls my-cls bar-cls'\n     });\n\nYou can use the '~=' operator instead, it will return Components with\nthe property that **exactly** matches one of the whitespace-separated\nvalues. This is also true for properties that only have *one* value:\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel[cls~=my-cls]');\n\nWill match both Components:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', {\n        cls: 'foo-cls my-cls bar-cls'\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.window.Window', {\n        cls: 'my-cls'\n    });\n\nGenerally, '=' operator is more suited for object properties other than\nCSS classes, while '~=' operator will work best with properties that\nhold lists of whitespace-separated CSS classes.\n\nThe '^=' operator will return Components with specified attribute that\nstart with the passed value:\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel[title^=Sales]');\n\nWill match the following Component:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', {\n        title: 'Sales estimate for Q4'\n    });\n\nThe '$=' operator will return Components with specified properties that\nend with the passed value:\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('field[fieldLabel$=name]');\n\nWill match the following Component:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.field.Text', {\n        fieldLabel: 'Enter your name'\n    });\n\nThe '/=' operator will return Components with specified properties that\nmatch the passed regular expression:\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('button[action/=\"edit|save\"]');\n\nWill match the following Components with a custom `action` property:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.button.Button', {\n         action: 'edit'\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.button.Button', {\n         action: 'save'\n    });\n\nWhen you need to use meta characters like [], (), etc. in your query, make sure\nto escape them with back slashes:\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel[title=\"^Sales for Q\\\\[1-4\\\\]\"]');\n\nThe following test will find panels with their `ownProperty` collapsed being equal to\n`false`. It will **not** match a collapsed property from the prototype chain.\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel[@collapsed=false]');\n\nMember expressions from candidate Components may be tested. If the expression returns\na *truthy* value, the candidate Component will be included in the query:\n\n    var disabledFields = myFormPanel.query(\"{isDisabled()}\");\n\nSuch expressions are executed in Component's context, and the above expression is\nsimilar to running this snippet for every Component in your application:\n\n     if (component.isDisabled()) {\n         matches.push(component);\n     }\n\nIt is important to use only methods that are available in **every** Component instance\nto avoid run time exceptions. If you need to match your Components with a custom\ncondition formula, you can augment `{@link Ext.Component}` to provide custom matcher that\nwill return `false` by default, and override it in your custom classes:\n\n     Ext.define('My.Component', {\n         override: 'Ext.Component',\n         myMatcher: function() { return false; }\n     });\n\n     Ext.define('My.Panel', {\n         extend: 'Ext.panel.Panel',\n         requires: ['My.Component'],     // Ensure that Component override is applied\n         myMatcher: function(selector) {\n             return selector === 'myPanel';\n         }\n     });\n\nAfter that you can use a selector with your custom matcher to find all instances\nof `My.Panel`:\n\n     Ext.ComponentQuery.query(\"{myMatcher('myPanel')}\");\n\nHowever if you really need to use a custom matcher, you may find it easier to implement\na custom Pseudo class instead (see below).\n\n## Conditional matching\n\nAttribute matchers can be combined to select only Components that match **all**\nconditions (logical AND operator):\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel[cls~=my-cls][floating=true][title$=\"sales data\"]');\n\nE.g., the query above will match only a Panel-descended Component that has 'my-cls'\nCSS class *and* is floating *and* with a title that ends with \"sales data\".\n\nExpressions separated with commas will match any Component that satisfies\n*either* expression (logical OR operator):\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('field[fieldLabel^=User], field[fieldLabel*=password]');\n\nE.g., the query above will match any field with field label starting with \"User\",\n*or* any field that has \"password\" in its label.\n\nIf you need to include a comma in an attribute matching expression, escape it with a\nbackslash:\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('field[fieldLabel^=\"User\\\\, foo\"], field[fieldLabel*=password]');\n\n## Pseudo classes\n\nPseudo classes may be used to filter results in the same way as in\n{@link Ext.dom.Query}. There are five default pseudo classes:\n\n* `not` Negates a selector.\n* `first` Filters out all except the first matching item for a selector.\n* `last` Filters out all except the last matching item for a selector.\n* `focusable` Filters out all except Components which by definition and configuration are\n     potentially able to recieve focus, regardless of their current state\n* `canfocus` Filters out all except Components which are curently able to recieve focus.\n     That is, they are defined and configured focusable, and they are also visible and enabled.\n* `nth-child` Filters Components by ordinal position in the selection.\n* `scrollable` Filters out all except Components which are scrollable.\n* `visible` Filters out hidden Components. May test deep visibility using `':visible(true)'`\n\nThese pseudo classes can be used with other matchers or without them:\n\n     // Select first direct child button in any panel\n     Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel > button:first');\n\n     // Select last field in Profile form\n     Ext.ComponentQuery.query('form[title=Profile] field:last');\n\n     // Find first focusable Component in a panel and focus it\n     panel.down(':canfocus').focus();\n\n     // Select any field that is not hidden in a form\n     form.query('field:not(hiddenfield)');\n\n     // Find last scrollable Component and reset its scroll positions.\n     tabpanel.down(':scrollable[hideMode=display]:last').getScrollable().scrollTo(0, 0);\n\nPseudo class `nth-child` can be used to find any child Component by its\nposition relative to its siblings. This class' handler takes one argument\nthat specifies the selection formula as `Xn` or `Xn+Y`:\n\n     // Find every odd field in a form\n     form.query('field:nth-child(2n+1)'); // or use shortcut: :nth-child(odd)\n\n     // Find every even field in a form\n     form.query('field:nth-child(2n)');   // or use shortcut: :nth-child(even)\n\n     // Find every 3rd field in a form\n     form.query('field:nth-child(3n)');\n\nPseudo classes can be combined to further filter the results, e.g., in the\nform example above we can modify the query to exclude hidden fields:\n\n     // Find every 3rd non-hidden field in a form\n     form.query('field:not(hiddenfield):nth-child(3n)');\n\nNote that when combining pseudo classes, whitespace is significant, i.e.\nthere should be no spaces between pseudo classes. This is a common mistake;\nif you accidentally type a space between `field` and `:not`, the query\nwill not return any result because it will mean \"find *field's children\nComponents* that are not hidden fields...\".\n\n## Custom pseudo classes\n\nIt is possible to define your own custom pseudo classes. In fact, a\npseudo class is just a property in `Ext.ComponentQuery.pseudos` object\nthat defines pseudo class name (property name) and pseudo class handler\n(property value):\n\n    // Function receives array and returns a filtered array.\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.pseudos.invalid = function(items) {\n        var i = 0, l = items.length, c, result = [];\n        for (; i < l; i++) {\n            if (!(c = items[i]).isValid()) {\n                result.push(c);\n            }\n        }\n        return result;\n    };\n\n    var invalidFields = myFormPanel.query('field:invalid');\n    if (invalidFields.length) {\n        invalidFields[0].getEl().scrollIntoView(myFormPanel.body);\n        for (var i = 0, l = invalidFields.length; i < l; i++) {\n            invalidFields[i].getEl().frame(\"red\");\n        }\n    }\n\nPseudo class handlers can be even more flexible, with a selector\nargument used to define the logic:\n\n     // Handler receives array of itmes and selector in parentheses\n     Ext.ComponentQuery.pseudos.titleRegex = function(components, selector) {\n         var i = 0, l = components.length, c, result = [], regex = new RegExp(selector);\n         for (; i < l; i++) {\n             c = components[i];\n             if (c.title && regex.test(c.title)) {\n                 result.push(c);\n             }\n         }\n         return result;\n     }\n\n     var salesTabs = tabPanel.query('panel:titleRegex(\"sales\\\\s+for\\\\s+201[123]\")');\n\nBe careful when using custom pseudo classes with MVC Controllers: when\nyou use a pseudo class in Controller's `control` or `listen` component\nselectors, the pseudo class' handler function will be called very often\nand may slow down your application significantly. A good rule of thumb\nis to always specify Component xtype with the pseudo class so that the\nhandlers are only called on Components that you need, and try to make\nthe condition checks as cheap in terms of execution time as possible.\nNote how in the example above, handler function checks that Component\n*has* a title first, before running regex test on it.\n\n## Query examples\n\nQueries return an array of Components. Here are some example queries:\n\n    // retrieve all Ext.Panels in the document by xtype\n    var panelsArray = Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel');\n\n    // retrieve all Ext.Panels within the container with an id myCt\n    var panelsWithinmyCt = Ext.ComponentQuery.query('#myCt panel');\n\n    // retrieve all direct children which are Ext.Panels within myCt\n    var directChildPanel = Ext.ComponentQuery.query('#myCt > panel');\n\n    // retrieve all grids or trees\n    var gridsAndTrees = Ext.ComponentQuery.query('gridpanel, treepanel');\n\n    // Focus first Component\n    myFormPanel.child(':canfocus').focus();\n\n    // Retrieve every odd text field in a form\n    myFormPanel.query('textfield:nth-child(odd)');\n\n    // Retrieve every even field in a form, excluding hidden fields\n    myFormPanel.query('field:not(hiddenfield):nth-child(even)');\n\n    // Retrieve every scrollable in a tabpanel\n    tabpanel.query(':scrollable');\n\nFor easy access to queries based from a particular Container see the\n{@link Ext.Container#method!query Ext.container.Container#query}, {@link Ext.Container#method!down Ext.container.Container#down} and\n{@link Ext.Container#method!child Ext.container.Container#child} methods.

        "doc": "A Container has all of the abilities of {@link Ext.Component}, but lets you nest other Components inside\nit. Applications are made up of lots of components, usually nested inside one another. Containers allow you to\nrender and arrange child Components inside them. Most apps have a single top-level Container called a Viewport,\nwhich takes up the entire screen. Inside of this are child components, for example in a mail app the Viewport\nContainer's two children might be a message List and an email preview pane.\n\nContainers give the following extra functionality:\n\n- Adding child Components at instantiation and run time\n- Removing child Components\n- Specifying a Layout\n\nLayouts determine how the child Components should be laid out on the screen. In our mail app example we'd use an\nHBox layout so that we can pin the email list to the left hand edge of the screen and allow the preview pane to\noccupy the rest. There are several layouts, each of which help you achieve your desired\napplication structure.\n\n## Adding Components to Containers\n\nAs we mentioned above, Containers are special Components that can have child Components arranged by a Layout. One of\nthe code samples above showed how to create a Panel with 2 child Panels already defined inside it but it's easy to\ndo this at run time too:\n\n    @example miniphone\n    //this is the Panel we'll be adding below\n    var aboutPanel = Ext.create('Ext.Panel', {\n        html: 'About this app'\n    });\n\n    //this is the Panel we'll be adding to\n    var mainPanel = Ext.create('Ext.Panel', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n\n        layout: 'hbox',\n        defaults: {\n            flex: 1\n        },\n\n        items: {\n            html: 'First Panel',\n            style: 'background-color: #5E99CC;'\n        }\n    });\n\n    //now we add the first panel inside the second\n    mainPanel.add(aboutPanel);\n\nHere we created three Panels in total. First we made the aboutPanel, which we might use to tell the user a little\nabout the app. Then we create one called mainPanel, which already contains a third Panel in its\n{@link Ext.Container#cfg!items items} configuration, with some dummy text (\"First Panel\"). Finally, we add the first\npanel to the second by calling the {@link Ext.Container#method!add add} method on `mainPanel`.\n\nIn this case we gave our mainPanel another hbox layout, but we also introduced some\n{@link Ext.Container#cfg!defaults defaults}. These are applied to every item in the Panel, so in this case every child\ninside `mainPanel` will be given a `flex: 1` configuration. The effect of this is that when we first render the screen\nonly a single child is present inside `mainPanel`, so that child takes up the full width available to it. Once the\n`mainPanel.add` line is called though, the `aboutPanel` is rendered inside of it and also given a `{@link #cfg!flex flex}` of 1, which will\ncause it and the first panel to both receive half the full width of the `mainPanel`.\n\nLikewise, it's easy to remove items from a Container:\n\n    mainPanel.remove(aboutPanel);\n\nAfter this line is run everything is back to how it was, with the first child panel once again taking up the full\nwidth inside `mainPanel`.\n",

See {@link #cfg!leadingBufferZone #leadingBufferZone},\n{@link #cfg!trailingBufferZone #trailingBufferZone} and {@link #cfg!purgePageCount #purgePageCount}.\n\nTo use a BufferedStore, initiate the loading process by loading the first page.

        "doc": "Fields are used to define the members of a Model. They aren't instantiated directly;\ninstead, when we create a class that extends {@link Ext.data.Model}, it automatically\ncreates Field instances for each field configured in a {@link Ext.data.Model}.\nFor example, we might set up a model like this:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            'name', 'email',\n            { name: 'age', type: 'int' },\n            { name: 'gender', type: 'string', defaultValue: 'Unknown' }\n        ]\n    });\n\nFour fields will have been created for the User Model - name, email, age and gender.\nNote that we specified a couple of different formats here; if we only pass in the string\nname of the field (as with name and email), the field is set up with the 'auto' type.\nIt's as if we'd done this instead:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            { name: 'name', type: 'auto' },\n            { name: 'email', type: 'auto' },\n            { name: 'age', type: 'int' },\n            { name: 'gender', type: 'string', defaultValue: 'Unknown' }\n        ]\n    });\n\n# Field Types\n\nFields come in various types. When declaring a field, the `type` property is used to\nspecify the type of `Field` derived class used to manage values.\n\nThe predefined set of types are:\n\n - {@link Ext.data.field.Field} (Default, implies no conversion)\n - {@link Ext.data.field.String}\n - {@link Ext.data.field.Integer}\n - {@link Ext.data.field.Number}\n - {@link Ext.data.field.Boolean}\n - {@link Ext.data.field.Date}\n\n# Conversion\n\nWhen reading fields it is often necessary to convert the values received before using\nthem or storing them in records. To handle these cases there is the\n`{@link #method!convert convert}` method. This method is passed the received value (as\nwell as the current record instance, but see below) and it returns the value to carry\nforward.\n\nFor `auto` fields there is no `{@link #method!convert convert}` method. This is for\nefficiency. For other field types, there are often `convert` methods. You can provide\na `{@link #cfg!convert convert}` config when the field is defined like this:\n\n     {\n         name: 'timestamp',\n\n         convert: function (value) {\n             return new Date(value);\n         }\n     }\n\nWhile this can be convenient, see below for details on defining Custom Types as that is\noften a better practice and avoids repeating these functions.\n\nNote that when a `{@link #cfg!defaultValue defaultValue}` is specified, it will also be passed through to\n`convert` (either to the `{@link #method!convert convert}` method or to the\n`{@link #cfg!convert convert} config)`.\n\n## Calculated Values\n\nIn some cases fields are the result of a calculation from other fields. Historically\nthis was a second role for `{@link #method!convert convert}` but that has some short\ncomings. The simpler solution is the `{@link #cfg!calculate calculate}` config.\n\nValues produced by `{@link #cfg!calculate calculate}` and `{@link #method!convert convert}`\nare stored in the record as with any other field. In fact, if we define a calculated\n\"firstName\" field and log out all of the data, we'll see this:\n\n    var ed = Ext.create('User', { name: 'Ed Spencer' });\n\n    console.log(ed.data);\n\n    //outputs this:\n    {\n        age: 0,\n        email: \"\",\n        firstName: \"Ed\",  // calculated field\n        gender: \"Unknown\",\n        name: \"Ed Spencer\"\n    }\n\n### Using `{@link #cfg!calculate calculate}`\n\n     {\n         name: 'firstName',\n\n         calculate: function (data) {\n             return data.name.split(' ')[0];\n         }\n     }\n\nUsing `{@link #cfg!calculate calculate}` is the simplest and safest way to define a\ncalculated field. The most important part of this is that, internally, the code of the\nsupplied function is parsed to extract its dependencies. In this case, the \"name\" field\nis the only dependency. This means that \"firstName\" will only need to be recalculated\nwhen \"name\" is modified.\n\n**Note:** Fields used by the calculate method must be explicitly defined in the\n{@link Ext.data.Model#cfg!fields #fields} of the model.\n\n### Using `convert`\n\nFollowing is the equivalent technique using `{@link #cfg!convert convert}`\n\n     {\n         name: 'firstName',\n\n         convert: function (value, record) {\n             return record.get('name').split(' ')[0];\n         },\n\n         depends: [ 'name' ]\n     }\n\nWhen a `{@link #method!convert convert}` function accepts a 2nd argument (a reference to\nthe record), it is considered a calculated field. If a `{@link #cfg!depends depends}`\nconfig is not provided then this field's dependencies are unknown. In this case, the\n`{@link #cfg!depends depends}` are provided as would be automatically determined with\nthe `{@link #cfg!calculate calculate}` config.\n\n### Updating\n\nFields modified with the {@link Ext.data.Model#method!set set} method will have their stored\nvalue set using the convert / calculate method when present.\n\nFor example:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.model.Employee', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'salary',\n            convert: function (val) {\n                var startingBonus = val * .1;\n                return val + startingBonus;\n            }\n        }],\n        convertOnSet: false\n    });\n\n    var tina = Ext.create('MyApp.model.Employee', {\n        salary: 50000\n    });\n\n    console.log(tina.get('salary')); // logs 55000\n\n    tina.set('salary', 60000);\n    console.log(tina.get('salary')); // logs 60000\n\nThis default behavior can be disabled by setting the Model's\n`{@link Ext.data.Model#cfg!convertOnSet Ext.data.Model#cfg-convertOnSet}` config to `false`.\n\n**Note:** convertOnSet `false` only prevents the convert / calculate call when the\nset `fieldName` param matches the field's `{@link #cfg!name #name}`.  See\n{@link Ext.data.Model#cfg!convertOnSet convertOnSet} for additional details.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nWhen a field's `{@link #method!convert convert}` method processes values from the record\n(vs. just the field's value), it is best to also provide a `{@link #cfg!depends depends}` config as shown\nabove. Fields that provide a `{@link #cfg!calculate calculate}` method must follow the\nproper form for using fields so that dependencies can be extracted.\n\nCalculated fields are processed after other fields based on their dependencies. Fields\nwith `{@link #method!convert convert}` methods that use the provided record that do *not*\nspecify a `{@link #cfg!depends depends}` config are processed as a group after all other\nfields since such converters can rely on anything in the record. The order of processing\nthese fields with respect to each other is unspecified and should not be relied upon.\n\n# Serialization\n\nTo handle the inverse scenario of `convert` there is the `serialize` method. This\nmethod is called to produce the value to send to a server based on the internal value\nas would be returned from `convert`. In most cases, these methods should \"round trip\"\na value:\n\n     assertEqual(value, field.serialize(field.convert(value)));\n\nBy default, only `{@link Ext.data.field.Date}` fields have a `serialize` method.\nOther types simply send their value unmodified.\n\n# Custom Types\n\nDevelopers may create their own application-specific data types by deriving from this\nclass. This is typically much better than applying multiple configuration values on\nfield instances as these often become repetitive.\n\nTo illustrate, we define a \"time\" field type that stores a time-of-day represented as a\nnumber of minutes since Midnight.\n\n     Ext.define('App.field.Time', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.field.Field',\n\n         alias: 'data.field.time',\n\n         timeFormat: 'g:i',\n\n         convert: function (value) {\n             if (value && Ext.isString(value)) {\n                 var date = Ext.Date.parse(value, this.timeFormat);\n                 if (!date) {\n                     return null;\n                 }\n                 return (date.getHours() - 1) * 60 + date.getMinutes();\n             }\n             return value;\n         }\n     });\n\n## Validation\n\nCustom field types can override the `{@link #method!validate validate}` method or\nprovide a set of `{@link #cfg!validators validators}`.\n\n     Ext.define('App.field.PhoneNumber', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.field.Field',\n\n         alias: 'data.field.phonenumber',\n\n         // Match U.S. phone numbers for example purposes\n         validators: {\n             type: 'format',\n             matcher: /\\d{3}\\-\\d{3}\\-\\d{4}/\n         }\n     });\n\nOnce the class is defined, fields can be declared using the new type (based on its\n`alias`) like so:\n\n     Ext.define('App.model.PhoneCall', {\n         fields: [\n             { name: 'startTime', type: 'time' },\n             { name: 'phoneNumber', type: 'phonenumber' }\n         ]\n     });\n",

        "doc": "This class is a base for all id generators. It also provides lookup of id generators by\ntheir id.\n\nGenerally, id generators are used to generate a primary key for new model instances. There\nare different approaches to solving this problem, so this mechanism has both simple use\ncases and is open to custom implementations. A {@link Ext.data.Model} requests id generation\nusing the {@link Ext.data.Model#cfg!identifier Ext.data.Model#identifier} property.\n\nThe following types of `identifiers` are provided:\n\n  * `{@link Ext.data.identifier.Sequential}`\n  * `{@link Ext.data.identifier.Negative}`\n  * `{@link Ext.data.identifier.Uuid}`\n\nIn most cases (other than `uuid`), the server is the only party that can generate\nauthoritative id values. This means that any id generated by an `identifier` should be\nconsider \"provisional\" and must eventually be reconciled with the server. This makes a\n`uuid` very attractive as an `identifier` because they are designed to be generated in\na distributed manner and therefore never require reconciliation.\n\nIt is common for id values to be generated as increasing integer values (1, 2, etc.) by\nthe server when records are inserted. A `{@link Ext.data.identifier.Negative}`\n`identifier` may be useful as it generates client-side values of -1, -2, etc.. These\nvalues are of the same data type (integer) and so can typically be read by servers\nusing typed languages (such as Java or C#) and easily recognized as provisional.\n\nIn the end, the choice of `identifier` strategy requires agreement between client and\nserver.\n\n# Identity, Type and Shared Generators\n\nIt is often desirable to share Generators to ensure uniqueness or common configuration.\nThis is done by giving Generator instances an id property by which they can be looked\nup using the {@link Ext.Factory#method!dataIdentifier dataIdentifier} method. To configure two {@link Ext.data.Model} classes\nto share one {@link Ext.data.identifier.Sequential} id generator, you simply\nassign them the same id:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModelA', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: {\n            type: 'sequential',\n            id: 'foo'\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModelB', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: {\n            type: 'sequential',\n            id: 'foo'\n        }\n    });\n\nTo make this as simple as possible for generator types that are shared by many (or all)\nModels, the Generator types (such as 'sequential' or 'uuid') are also reserved as\ngenerator ids. This is used by the {@link Ext.data.identifier.Uuid} which has an id equal\nto its type ('uuid'). In other words, the following Models share the same generator:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModelX', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: 'uuid'\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModelY', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: 'uuid'\n    });\n\nThis can be overridden (by specifying the id explicitly), but there is no particularly\ngood reason to do so for this generator type.\n\n# Creating Custom Generators\n\nAn id generator should derive from this class and implement the {@link #method!generate #generate} method.\n\nTo register an id generator type, a derived class should provide an `alias` like so:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.identifier.Custom', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.identifier.Generator',\n        alias: 'data.identifier.custom',\n        config: {\n            configProp: 42 // some config property w/default value\n        }\n\n        generate: function () {\n            return ... // a new id\n        }\n    });\n\nUsing the custom id generator is then straightforward:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModel', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: 'custom'\n    });\n    // or...\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModel', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: {\n            type: 'custom',\n            configProp: value\n        }\n    });\n\nIt is not recommended to mix shared generators with generator configuration. This leads\nto unpredictable results unless all configurations match (which is also redundant). In\nsuch cases, a custom generator with a default id is the best approach.\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.identifier.Custom', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.identifier.Sequential',\n        alias: 'data.identifier.custom',\n\n        config: {\n            id: 'custom',\n            prefix: 'ID_',\n            seed: 1000\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModelX', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: 'custom'\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModelY', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: 'custom'\n    });\n\n    // the above models share a generator that produces ID_1000, ID_1001, etc..\n",

        "doc": "A Model or Entity represents some object that your application manages. For example, one\nmight define a Model for Users, Products, Cars, or other real-world object that we want\nto model in the system. Models are used by {@link Ext.data.Store}, which are in\nturn used by many of the data-bound components in Ext.\n\n# Fields\n\nModels are defined as a set of fields and any arbitrary methods and properties relevant\nto the model. For example:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            {name: 'name',  type: 'string'},\n            {name: 'age',   type: 'int', convert: null},\n            {name: 'phone', type: 'string'},\n            {name: 'alive', type: 'boolean', defaultValue: true, convert: null}\n        ],\n\n        changeName: function() {\n            var oldName = this.get('name'),\n                newName = oldName + \" The Barbarian\";\n\n            this.set('name', newName);\n        }\n    });\n\nNow we can create instances of our User model and call any model logic we defined:\n\n    var user = Ext.create('User', {\n        id   : 'ABCD12345',\n        name : 'Conan',\n        age  : 24,\n        phone: '555-555-5555'\n    });\n\n    user.changeName();\n    user.get('name'); //returns \"Conan The Barbarian\"\n\nBy default, the built in field types such as number and boolean coerce string values\nin the raw data by virtue of their {@link Ext.data.field.Field#method!convert Ext.data.field.Field#method-convert} method.\nWhen the server can be relied upon to send data in a format that does not need to be\nconverted, disabling this can improve performance. The {@link Ext.data.reader.Json}\nand {@link Ext.data.reader.Array} readers are likely candidates for this\noptimization. To disable field conversions you simply specify `null` for the field's\n{@link Ext.data.field.Field#cfg!convert convert config}.\n\n## The \"id\" Field and `{@link #cfg!idProperty idProperty}`\n\nA Model definition always has an *identifying field* which should yield a unique key\nfor each instance. By default, a field named \"id\" will be created with a\n{@link Ext.data.field.Field#cfg!mapping mapping} of \"id\". This happens because of the default\n{@link #cfg!idProperty #idProperty} provided in Model definitions.\n\nTo alter which field is the identifying field, use the {@link #cfg!idProperty #idProperty} config.\n\n# Validators\n\nModels have built-in support for field validators. Validators are added to models as in\nthe follow example:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            { name: 'name',     type: 'string' },\n            { name: 'age',      type: 'int' },\n            { name: 'phone',    type: 'string' },\n            { name: 'gender',   type: 'string' },\n            { name: 'username', type: 'string' },\n            { name: 'alive',    type: 'boolean', defaultValue: true }\n        ],\n\n        validators: {\n            age: 'presence',\n            name: { type: 'length', min: 2 },\n            gender: { type: 'inclusion', list: ['Male', 'Female'] },\n            username: [\n                { type: 'exclusion', list: ['Admin', 'Operator'] },\n                { type: 'format', matcher: /([a-z]+)[0-9]{2,3}/i }\n            ]\n        }\n    });\n\nThe derived type of `{@link Ext.data.field.Field}` can also provide validation. If `{@link #cfg!validators validators}`\nneed to be duplicated on multiple fields, instead consider creating a custom field type.\n\n## Validation\n\nThe results of the validators can be retrieved via the \"associated\" validation record:\n\n    var instance = Ext.create('User', {\n        name: 'Ed',\n        gender: 'Male',\n        username: 'edspencer'\n    });\n\n    var validation = instance.getValidation();\n\nThe returned object is an instance of `{@link Ext.data.Validation}` and has as its fields the\nresult of the field `{@link #cfg!validators validators}`. The validation object is \"dirty\" if there are one or\nmore validation errors present.\n\nThis record is also available when using data binding as a \"pseudo-association\" called\n\"validation\". This pseudo-association can be hidden by an explicitly declared\nassociation by the same name (for compatibility reasons), but doing so is not\nrecommended.\n\nThe `{@link Ext.Component#modelValidation}` config can be used to enable automatic\nbinding from the \"validation\" of a record to the form fields that may be bound to its\nvalues.\n\n# Associations\n\nModels often have associations with other Models. These associations can be defined by\nfields (often called \"foreign keys\") or by other data such as a many-to-many (or \"matrix\").\nSee {@link Ext.data.schema.Association} for information about configuring and using associations.\n\n# Using a Proxy\n\nModels are great for representing types of data and relationships, but sooner or later we're going to want to load or\nsave that data somewhere. All loading and saving of data is handled via a {@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy}, which\ncan be set directly on the Model:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'name', 'email'],\n\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'rest',\n            url : '/users'\n        }\n    });\n\nHere we've set up a {@link Ext.data.proxy.Rest}, which knows how to load and save data to and from a\nRESTful backend. Let's see how this works:\n\n    var user = Ext.create('User', {name: 'Ed Spencer', email: 'ed@sencha.com'});\n\n    user.save(); //POST /users\n\nCalling {@link #method!save #save} on the new Model instance tells the configured RestProxy that we wish to persist this Model's\ndata onto our server. RestProxy figures out that this Model hasn't been saved before because it doesn't have an id,\nand performs the appropriate action - in this case issuing a POST request to the url we configured (/users). We\nconfigure any Proxy on any Model and always follow this API - see {@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy} for a full list.\n\nLoading data via the Proxy is accomplished with the static `load` method:\n\n    //Uses the configured RestProxy to make a GET request to /users/123\n    User.load(123, {\n        success: function(user) {\n            console.log(user.getId()); //logs 123\n        }\n    });\n\nModels can also be updated and destroyed easily:\n\n    //the user Model we loaded in the last snippet:\n    user.set('name', 'Edward Spencer');\n\n    //tells the Proxy to save the Model. In this case it will perform a PUT request to /users/123 as this Model already has an id\n    user.save({\n        success: function() {\n            console.log('The User was updated');\n        }\n    });\n\n    //tells the Proxy to destroy the Model. Performs a DELETE request to /users/123\n    user.erase({\n        success: function() {\n            console.log('The User was destroyed!');\n        }\n    });\n\n# HTTP Parameter names when using a {@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax}\n\nBy default, the model ID is specified in an HTTP parameter named `id`. To change the\nname of this parameter use the Proxy's {@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax#cfg!idParam idParam}\nconfiguration.\n\nParameters for other commonly passed values such as\n{@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax#cfg!pageParam page number} or\n{@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax#cfg!startParam start row} may also be configured.\n\n# Usage in Stores\n\nIt is very common to want to load a set of Model instances to be displayed and manipulated in the UI. We do this by\ncreating a {@link Ext.data.Store}:\n\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: 'User'\n    });\n\n    //uses the Proxy we set up on Model to load the Store data\n    store.load();\n\nA Store is just a collection of Model instances - usually loaded from a server somewhere. Store can also maintain a\nset of added, updated and removed Model instances to be synchronized with the server via the Proxy. See the {@link Ext.data.Store} for more information on Stores.\n",

Alternatively,\nthe server could respond with records that correspond one-to-one to those sent in\nthe `operation`.\n\nFor example the client could send a `{@link #static-method!create create}` with this data:\n\n     [ { id: -1, name: 'Clark Kent' },\n       { id: -2, name: 'Peter Parker' },\n       { id: -3, name: 'Bruce Banner' } ]\n\nAnd the server could respond in the same order:\n\n     [ { id: 427 },      // updates id = -1\n       { id: 428 },      // updates id = -2\n       { id: 429 } ]     // updates id = -3\n\nOr using `{@link #cfg!clientIdProperty clientIdProperty}` the server could respond in arbitrary order:\n\n     [ { id: 427, clientId: -3 },\n       { id: 428, clientId: -1 },\n       { id: 429, clientId: -2 } ]\n\n**IMPORTANT:** When upgrading from previous versions be aware that this property\nused to perform the role of `{@link Ext.data.writer.Writer#cfg!clientIdProperty Ext.data.writer.Writer#clientIdProperty}` as\nwell as that described above. To continue send a client-generated id as other than\nthe `{@link #cfg!idProperty idProperty}`, set `{@link #cfg!clientIdProperty clientIdProperty}` on the `writer`. A better solution, however,\nis most likely a properly configured `{@link #cfg!identifier identifier}` as that would work better with\nassociations.\n",

        "doc": "AjaxProxy is one of the most widely-used ways of getting data into your application. It uses AJAX requests to load\ndata from the server, usually to be placed into a {@link Ext.data.Store}. Let's take a look at a typical setup.\nHere we're going to set up a Store that has an AjaxProxy. To prepare, we'll also set up a {@link Ext.data.Model}:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'name', 'email']\n    });\n\n    //The Store contains the AjaxProxy as an inline configuration\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: 'User',\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'ajax',\n            url : 'users.json'\n        }\n    });\n\n    store.load();\n\nOur example is going to load user data into a Store, so we start off by defining a {@link Ext.data.Model} with\nthe fields that we expect the server to return. Next we set up the Store itself, along with a\n{@link Ext.data.Store#cfg!proxy proxy} configuration. This configuration was automatically turned into an\nExt.data.proxy.Ajax instance, with the url we specified being passed into AjaxProxy's constructor.\nIt's as if we'd done this:\n\n    new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n        url: 'users.json',\n        model: 'User',\n        reader: 'json'\n    });\n\nA couple of extra configurations appeared here - {@link #cfg!model #model} and {@link #cfg!reader #reader}. These are set by default when we\ncreate the proxy via the Store - the Store already knows about the Model, and Proxy's default {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader} is {@link Ext.data.reader.Json}.\n\nNow when we call store.load(), the AjaxProxy springs into action, making a request to the url we configured\n('users.json' in this case). As we're performing a read, it sends a GET request to that url (see\n{@link #cfg!actionMethods #actionMethods} to customize this - by default any kind of read will be sent as a GET request and any kind of write\nwill be sent as a POST request).\n\n# Limitations\n\nAjaxProxy cannot be used to retrieve data from other domains. If your application is running on http://domainA.com it\ncannot load data from http://domainB.com because browsers have a built-in security policy that prohibits domains\ntalking to each other via AJAX.\n\nIf you need to read data from another domain and can't set up a proxy server (some software that runs on your own\ndomain's web server and transparently forwards requests to http://domainB.com, making it look like they actually came\nfrom http://domainA.com), you can use {@link Ext.data.proxy.JsonP} and a technique known as JSON-P (JSON with\nPadding), which can help you get around the problem so long as the server on http://domainB.com is set up to support\nJSON-P responses. See {@link Ext.data.proxy.JsonP}'s introduction docs for more details.\n\n# Readers and Writers\n\nAjaxProxy can be configured to use any type of {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader} to decode the server's response.\nIf no Reader is supplied, AjaxProxy will default to using a {@link Ext.data.reader.Json}. Reader\nconfiguration can be passed in as a simple object, which the Proxy automatically turns into a {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader} instance:\n\n    var proxy = new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n        model: 'User',\n        reader: {\n            type: 'xml',\n            rootProperty: 'users'\n        }\n    });\n\n    proxy.getReader(); //returns an XmlReader instance based on the config we supplied\n\n# Url generation\n\nAjaxProxy automatically inserts any sorting, filtering, paging and grouping options into the url it generates for\neach request. These are controlled with the following configuration options:\n\n- {@link #cfg!pageParam #pageParam} - controls how the page number is sent to the server (see also {@link #cfg!startParam #startParam} and {@link #cfg!limitParam #limitParam})\n- {@link #cfg!sortParam #sortParam} - controls how sort information is sent to the server\n- {@link #cfg!groupParam #groupParam} - controls how grouping information is sent to the server\n- {@link #cfg!filterParam #filterParam} - controls how filter information is sent to the server\n\nEach request sent by AjaxProxy is described by an {@link Ext.data.operation.Operation}. To see how we can customize\nthe generated urls, let's say we're loading the Proxy with the following Operation:\n\n    var proxy = new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n        url: '/users'\n    });\n\n    var operation = proxy.createOperation('read', {\n        page  : 2\n    });\n\nNow we'll issue the request for this Operation by calling {@link #method!read #read}:\n\n    proxy.read(operation); //GET /users?page=2\n\nEasy enough - the Proxy just copied the page property from the Operation. We can customize how this page data is sent\nto the server:\n\n    var proxy = new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n        url: '/users',\n        pageParam: 'pageNumber'\n    });\n\n    proxy.read(operation); //GET /users?pageNumber=2\n\nAlternatively, our Operation could have been configured to send start and limit parameters instead of page:\n\n    var proxy = new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n        url: '/users'\n    });\n\n    var operation = proxy.createOperation('read', {\n        start : 50,\n        limit : 25\n    });\n\n    proxy.read(operation); //GET /users?start=50&limit;=25\n\nAgain we can customize this url:\n\n    var proxy = new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n        url: '/users',\n        startParam: 'startIndex',\n        limitParam: 'limitIndex'\n    });\n\n    proxy.read(operation); //GET /users?startIndex=50&limitIndex;=25\n\nAjaxProxy will also send sort and filter information to the server. Let's take a look at how this looks with a more\nexpressive Operation object:\n\n    var operation = proxy.createOperation('read', {\n        sorters: [\n            new Ext.util.Sorter({\n                property : 'name',\n                direction: 'ASC'\n            }),\n            new Ext.util.Sorter({\n                property : 'age',\n                direction: 'DESC'\n            })\n        ],\n        filters: [\n            new Ext.util.Filter({\n                property: 'eyeColor',\n                value   : 'brown'\n            })\n        ]\n    });\n\nThis is the type of object that is generated internally when loading a {@link Ext.data.Store} with sorters and\nfilters defined. By default the AjaxProxy will JSON encode the sorters and filters, resulting in something like this\n(note that the url is escaped before sending the request, but is left unescaped here for clarity):\n\n    var proxy = new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n        url: '/users'\n    });\n\n    proxy.read(operation); //GET /users?sort=[{\"property\":\"name\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"},{\"property\":\"age\",\"direction\":\"DESC\"}]&filter;=[{\"property\":\"eyeColor\",\"value\":\"brown\"}]\n\nWe can again customize how this is created by supplying a few configuration options. Let's say our server is set up\nto receive sorting information is a format like \"sortBy=name#ASC,age#DESC\". We can configure AjaxProxy to provide\nthat format like this:\n\n     var proxy = new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n         url: '/users',\n         sortParam: 'sortBy',\n         filterParam: 'filterBy',\n\n         //our custom implementation of sorter encoding - turns our sorters into \"name#ASC,age#DESC\"\n         encodeSorters: function(sorters) {\n             var length   = sorters.length,\n                 sortStrs = [],\n                 sorter, i;\n\n             for (i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n                 sorter = sorters[i];\n\n                 sortStrs[i] = sorter.property + '#' + sorter.direction\n             }\n\n             return sortStrs.join(\",\");\n         }\n     });\n\n     proxy.read(operation); //GET /users?sortBy=name#ASC,age#DESC&filterBy;=[{\"property\":\"eyeColor\",\"value\":\"brown\"}]\n\nWe can also provide a custom {@link #method!encodeFilters #encodeFilters} function to encode our filters.\n\n# Debugging your Ajax Proxy\n\nIf the data is not being loaded into the store as expected, it could be due to a mismatch between the the way that the {@link #cfg!reader #reader}\nis configured, and the shape of the incoming data.\n\nTo debug from the point that your data arrives back from the network, set a breakpoint inside the callback function\ncreated in the `{@link #method!createRequestCallback createRequestCallback}` method of the Ajax Proxy class, and follow the data to where the {@link #cfg!reader #reader} attempts\nto consume it.\n",

        "doc": "This class is used to send requests to the server using {@link Ext.direct.Manager}.\nWhen a request is made, the transport mechanism is handed off to the appropriate\n{@link Ext.direct.RemotingProvider} to complete the call.\n\n# Specifying the functions\n\nThis proxy expects Direct remoting method to be passed in order to be able to complete requests,\none Direct function per CRUD method. This is done via {@link #cfg!api #api} configuration:\n\n     api: {\n         read: 'MyApp.readRecords',\n         create: 'MyApp.createRecords',\n         update: 'MyApp.updateRecords',\n         destroy: 'MyApp.destroyRecords'\n     }\n\nYou can also use a `prefix` config to avoid duplicating full namespaces for Direct functions:\n\n     api: {\n         prefix: 'MyApp',\n         read: 'readRecords',\n         create: 'createRecords',\n         update: 'updateRecords',\n         destroy: 'destroyRecords'\n     }\n\nThe preferred way is to specify function names to allow late resolution, however you can\npass function references instead if desired:\n\n     api: {\n         read: MyApp.readRecords,\n         create: MyApp.createRecords,\n         update: MyApp.updateRecords,\n         destroy: MyApp.destroyRecords\n     }\n\nThis method of configuring API is not recommended because this way the Direct functions\nneed to be created very early in the application lifecycle, long before {@link Ext.app.Application}\ninstance is initialized.\n\nYou can also use the {@link #cfg!directFn #directFn} configuration instead of {@link #cfg!api #api}. This will use\nthe same Direct function for all types of requests.\n\n# Server API\n\nThe server side methods are expected to conform to the following calling conventions:\n\n## `{@link #method!read read}`\n\nAccept one argument which is either named arguments in an object (default), or an array\nof values depending on the {@link #cfg!paramsAsHash #paramsAsHash} configuration. Return an array of records\nor an object with format recognizable by the configured {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader}\ninstance.\n\nExample {@link Ext.direct.RemotingProvider#cfg!actions Direct API declaration}:\n\n     actions: {\n         MyApp: [{\n             name: 'readRecords',\n             params: [],\n             strict: false\n         }]\n     }\n\nExample function invocation:\n\n     MyApp.readRecords(\n         {\n             start: 0,\n             limit: 10\n         },\n         // Results are passed to the callback function\n         function(records) {\n             console.log(records);\n             // Logs:  [{ id: 'r0', text: 'foo' }, { id: 'r1', text: 'bar' }]\n         }\n     );\n\n## `create`\n\nAccept one ordered argument which is either an object with data for the new record,\nor an array of objects for multiple records. Return an array of identifiers for actually\ncreated records. See {@link Ext.data.Model#cfg!clientIdProperty Ext.data.Model#clientIdProperty} for more information.\n\nExample {@link Ext.direct.RemotingProvider#cfg!actions Direct API declaration}:\n\n     actions: [\n         MyApp: [{\n             name: 'createRecords',\n             len: 1\n         }]\n     }\n\nExample function invocation:\n\n     MyApp.createRecords(\n         [\n             { id: 0, text: 'foo' },\n             { id: 1, text: 'bar' }\n         ],\n         // Results are passed to the callback function\n         function(records) {\n             console.log(records);\n             // Logs: [{ clientId: 0, id: 'r0' }, { clientId: 1, id: 'r1' }]\n         }\n     );\n\n## `{@link #method!update update}`\n\nAccept one ordered argument which is either an object with updated data and valid\nrecord identifier, or an array of objects for multiple records. Return an array of\nobjects with updated record data.\n\nExample {@link Ext.direct.RemotingProvider#cfg!actions Direct API declaration}:\n\n     actions: [\n         MyApp: [{\n             name: 'updateRecords',\n             len: 1\n         }]\n     }\n\nExample function invocation:\n\n     MyApp.updateRecords(\n         [\n             { id: 'r0', text: 'blerg' },\n             { id: 'r1', text: 'throbbe' }\n         ],\n         // Results are passed to the callback function\n         function(records) {\n             console.log(records);\n             // Logs: [{ id: 'r0', text: 'blerg' }, { id: 'r1', text: 'throbbe }]\n         }\n     );\n\n## `{@link #method!destroy destroy}`\n\nAccept one ordered argument which is an array of record identifiers to be deleted.\nReturn an object with at least one {@link Ext.data.reader.Json#cfg!successProperty Ext.data.reader.Json#successProperty}\nproperty set to `true` or `false`, with more optional properties recognizable by configured\n{@link Ext.data.reader.Reader} instance.\n\nExample {@link Ext.direct.RemotingProvider#cfg!actions Direct API declaration}:\n\n     actions: [\n         MyApp: [{\n             name: 'destroyRecords',\n             len: 1\n         }]\n     }\n\nExample function invocation:\n\n     MyApp.destroyRecords(\n         [\n             { id: 'r0' },\n             { id: 'r1' }\n         ],\n         // Results are passed to the callback function\n         function(result) {\n             // Default successProperty is `success`\n             if (!result.success) {\n                 // Handle the error\n             }\n         }\n     );\n\n## Read method parameters\n\nDirect proxy provides options to help configure which parameters will be sent to the server\nfor Read operations. By setting the {@link #cfg!paramsAsHash #paramsAsHash} option to `true`, the proxy will\nsend an object literal containing each of the passed parameters. This is the default. When\n{@link #cfg!paramsAsHash #paramsAsHash} is set to `false`, Proxy will pass the Read function an array of values\ninstead of an object, with the order determined by {@link #cfg!paramOrder #paramOrder} value.\n\nSetting {@link #cfg!paramOrder #paramOrder} to any value other than `undefined` will automatically reset\n{@link #cfg!paramsAsHash #paramsAsHash} to `false`.\n\n# Example Usage\n\n     Ext.define('User', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n         fields: ['firstName', 'lastName']\n     });\n\n     Ext.define('Users', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.Store',\n         model: 'User',\n         proxy: {\n             type: 'direct',\n             directFn: 'MyApp.getUsers',\n             // Tells the proxy to pass `start` and `limit` as two by-position arguments:\n             paramOrder: 'start,limit'\n         }\n     });\n\n     var store = new Users();\n     store.load();\n",

        "type": "Ext.data.proxy.JsonP",
        "doc": "The JsonP proxy is useful when you need to load data from a domain other than the one your application is running on. If\nyour application is running on http://domainA.com it cannot use {@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax} to load its data\nfrom http://domainB.com because cross-domain ajax requests are prohibited by the browser.\n\nWe can get around this using a JsonP proxy. JsonP proxy injects a `<script>` tag into the DOM whenever an AJAX request\nwould usually be made. Let's say we want to load data from http://domainB.com/users - the script tag that would be\ninjected might look like this:\n\n    <script src=\"http://domainB.com/users?callback=someCallback\"></script>\n\nWhen we inject the tag above, the browser makes a request to that url and includes the response as if it was any\nother type of JavaScript include. By passing a callback in the url above, we're telling domainB's server that we want\nto be notified when the result comes in and that it should call our callback function with the data it sends back. So\nlong as the server formats the response to look like this, everything will work:\n\n    someCallback({\n        users: [\n            {\n                id: 1,\n                name: \"Ed Spencer\",\n                email: \"ed@sencha.com\"\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n\nAs soon as the script finishes loading, the 'someCallback' function that we passed in the url is called with the JSON\nobject that the server returned.\n\nJsonP proxy takes care of all of this automatically. It formats the url you pass, adding the callback parameter\nautomatically. It even creates a temporary callback function, waits for it to be called and then puts the data into\nthe Proxy making it look just like you loaded it through a normal {@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax}. Here's how\nwe might set that up:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'name', 'email']\n    });\n\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: 'User',\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'jsonp',\n            url : 'http://domainB.com/users'\n        }\n    });\n\n    store.load();\n\nThat's all we need to do - JsonP proxy takes care of the rest. In this case the Proxy will have injected a script tag\nlike this:\n\n    <script src=\"http://domainB.com/users?callback=callback1\"></script>\n\n# Customization\n\nThis script tag can be customized using the {@link #cfg!callbackKey #callbackKey} configuration. For example:\n\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: 'User',\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'jsonp',\n            url : 'http://domainB.com/users',\n            callbackKey: 'theCallbackFunction'\n        }\n    });\n\n    store.load();\n\nWould inject a script tag like this:\n\n    <script src=\"http://domainB.com/users?theCallbackFunction=callback1\"></script>\n\n# Implementing on the server side\n\nThe remote server side needs to be configured to return data in this format. Here are suggestions for how you might\nachieve this using Java, PHP and ASP.net:\n\nJava:\n\n    boolean jsonP = false;\n    String cb = request.getParameter(\"callback\");\n    if (cb != null) {\n        jsonP = true;\n        response.setContentType(\"text/javascript\");\n    } else {\n        response.setContentType(\"application/x-json\");\n    }\n    Writer out = response.getWriter();\n    if (jsonP) {\n        out.write(cb + \"(\");\n    }\n    out.print(dataBlock.toJsonString());\n    if (jsonP) {\n        out.write(\");\");\n    }\n\nPHP:\n\n    $callback = $_REQUEST['callback'];\n\n    // Create the output object.\n    $output = array('a' => 'Apple', 'b' => 'Banana');\n\n    //start output\n    if ($callback) {\n        header('Content-Type: text/javascript');\n        echo $callback . '(' . json_encode($output) . ');';\n    } else {\n        header('Content-Type: application/x-json');\n        echo json_encode($output);\n    }\n\nASP.net:\n\n    String jsonString = \"{success: true}\";\n    String cb = Request.Params.Get(\"callback\");\n    String responseString = \"\";\n    if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(cb)) {\n        responseString = cb + \"(\" + jsonString + \")\";\n    } else {\n        responseString = jsonString;\n    }\n    Response.Write(responseString);\n",

        "doc": "The LocalStorageProxy uses the new HTML5 localStorage API to save {@link Ext.data.Model} data locally on the\nclient browser. HTML5 localStorage is a key-value store (e.g. cannot save complex objects like JSON), so\nLocalStorageProxy automatically serializes and deserializes data when saving and retrieving it.\n\nlocalStorage is extremely useful for saving user-specific information without needing to build server-side\ninfrastructure to support it. Let's imagine we're writing a Twitter search application and want to save the user's\nsearches locally so they can easily perform a saved search again later. We'd start by creating a Search model:\n\n    Ext.define('Search', {\n        fields: ['id', 'query'],\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'localstorage',\n            id  : 'twitter-Searches'\n        }\n    });\n\nOur Search model contains just two fields - id and query - plus a Proxy definition. The only configuration we need to\npass to the LocalStorage proxy is an {@link #cfg!id #id}. This is important as it separates the Model data in this Proxy from\nall others. The localStorage API puts all data into a single shared namespace, so by setting an id we enable\nLocalStorageProxy to manage the saved Search data.\n\nSaving our data into localStorage is easy and would usually be done with a {@link Ext.data.Store}:\n\n    //our Store automatically picks up the LocalStorageProxy defined on the Search model\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: \"Search\"\n    });\n\n    //loads any existing Search data from localStorage\n    store.load();\n\n    //now add some Searches\n    store.add({query: 'Sencha Touch'});\n    store.add({query: 'Ext JS'});\n\n    //finally, save our Search data to localStorage\n    store.sync();\n\nThe LocalStorageProxy automatically gives our new Searches an id when we call store.sync(). It encodes the Model data\nand places it into localStorage. We can also save directly to localStorage, bypassing the Store altogether:\n\n    var search = Ext.create('Search', {query: 'Sencha Animator'});\n\n    //uses the configured LocalStorageProxy to save the new Search to localStorage\n    search.save();\n\n# Limitations\n\nIf this proxy is used in a browser where local storage is not supported, the constructor will throw an error. A local\nstorage proxy requires a unique ID which is used as a key in which all record data are stored in the local storage\nobject.\n\nIt's important to supply this unique ID as it cannot be reliably determined otherwise. If no id is provided but the\nattached store has a storeId, the storeId will be used. If neither option is presented the proxy will throw an error.\n",

These proxies include:\n\n- {@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax} - sends requests to a server on the same domain\n- {@link Ext.data.proxy.JsonP} - uses JSON-P to send requests to a server on a different domain\n- {@link Ext.data.proxy.Rest} - uses RESTful HTTP methods (GET/PUT/POST/DELETE) to communicate with server\n- {@link Ext.data.proxy.Direct} - uses {@link Ext.direct.Manager} to send requests\n\nProxies operate on the principle that all operations performed are either Create, Read, Update or Delete. These four\noperations are mapped to the methods {@link #create}, {@link #method!read #read}, {@link #method!update #update} and {@link #method!erase #erase}\nrespectively. Each Proxy subclass implements these functions.\n\nThe CRUD methods each expect an {@link Ext.data.operation.Operation} object as the sole argument. The Operation\nencapsulates information about the action the Store wishes to perform, the {@link Ext.data.Model} instances\nthat are to be modified, etc. See the {@link Ext.data.operation.Operation} documentation for more details. Each CRUD\nmethod also accepts a callback function to be called asynchronously on completion.\n\nProxies also support batching of Operations via a {@link Ext.data.Batch} object, invoked by the {@link #method!batch #batch}\nmethod.\n",

        "doc": "The Rest proxy is a specialization of the {@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax} which simply maps the four actions\n(create, read, update and destroy) to RESTful HTTP verbs. For example, let's set up a {@link Ext.data.Model}\nwith an inline Rest proxy\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'name', 'email'],\n\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'rest',\n            url : '/users'\n        }\n    });\n\nNow we can create a new User instance and save it via the Rest proxy. Doing this will cause the Proxy to send a POST\nrequest to '/users':\n\n    var user = Ext.create('User', {name: 'Ed Spencer', email: 'ed@sencha.com'});\n\n    user.save(); //POST /users\n\nLet's expand this a little and provide a callback for the {@link Ext.data.Model#method!save Ext.data.Model#save} call to update the Model once\nit has been created. We'll assume the creation went successfully and that the server gave this user an ID of 123:\n\n    user.save({\n        success: function(user) {\n            user.set('name', 'Khan Noonien Singh');\n\n            user.save(); //PUT /users/123\n        }\n    });\n\nNow that we're no longer creating a new Model instance, the request method is changed to an HTTP PUT, targeting the\nrelevant url for that user. Now let's delete this user, which will use the DELETE method:\n\n        user.erase(); //DELETE /users/123\n\nFinally, when we perform a load of a Model or Store, Rest proxy will use the GET method:\n\n    //1. Load via Store\n\n    //the Store automatically picks up the Proxy from the User model\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: 'User'\n    });\n\n    store.load(); //GET /users\n\n    //2. Load directly from the Model\n\n    //GET /users/123\n    User.load(123, {\n        success: function(user) {\n            console.log(user.getId()); //outputs 123\n        }\n    });\n\n# Url generation\n\nThe Rest proxy is able to automatically generate the urls above based on two configuration options - {@link #cfg!appendId #appendId} and\n{@link #cfg!format #format}. If appendId is true (it is by default) then Rest proxy will automatically append the ID of the Model\ninstance in question to the configured url, resulting in the '/users/123' that we saw above.\n\nIf the request is not for a specific Model instance (e.g. loading a Store), the url is not appended with an id.\nThe Rest proxy will automatically insert a '/' before the ID if one is not already present.\n\n    new Ext.data.proxy.Rest({\n        url: '/users',\n        appendId: true //default\n    });\n\n    // Collection url: /users\n    // Instance url  : /users/123\n\nThe Rest proxy can also optionally append a format string to the end of any generated url:\n\n    new Ext.data.proxy.Rest({\n        url: '/users',\n        format: 'json'\n    });\n\n    // Collection url: /users.json\n    // Instance url  : /users/123.json\n\nIf further customization is needed, simply implement the {@link #method!buildUrl #buildUrl} method and add your custom generated url\nonto the {@link Ext.data.Request} object that is passed to buildUrl. See [Rest proxy's implementation][1] for\nan example of how to achieve this.\n\nNote that Rest proxy inherits from {@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax}, which already injects all of the sorter,\nfilter, group and paging options into the generated url. See the {@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax} for more\ndetails.\n\n[1]: source/Rest.html#Ext-data-proxy-Rest-method-buildUrl\n",

If you're still interested, here's a brief description of what\nProxyStore is and is not.\n\nProxyStore provides the basic configuration for anything that can be considered a Store. It expects to be\ngiven a {@link Ext.data.Model} that represents the type of data in the Store. It also expects to be given a\n{@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy} that handles the loading of data into the Store.\n\nProxyStore provides a few helpful methods such as {@link #method!load #method-load} and {@link #method!sync #sync}, which load and save data\nrespectively, passing the requests through the configured {@link #cfg!proxy #proxy}.\n\nBuilt-in Store subclasses add extra behavior to each of these functions.

This usually\nhappens as a result of loading a Store - for example we might create something like this:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'name', 'email']\n    });\n\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: 'User',\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'ajax',\n            url : 'users.json',\n            reader: {\n                type: 'json'\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nThe example above creates a 'User' model. Models are explained in the {@link Ext.data.Model} docs if you're\nnot already familiar with them.\n\nWe created the simplest type of JSON Reader possible by simply telling our {@link Ext.data.Store}'s\n{@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy} that we want a JSON Reader. The Store automatically passes the configured model to the\nStore, so it is as if we passed this instead:\n\n    reader: {\n        type : 'json',\n        model: 'User'\n    }\n\nThe reader we set up is ready to read data from our server - at the moment it will accept a response like this:\n\n    [\n        {\n            \"id\": 1,\n            \"name\": \"Ed Spencer\",\n            \"email\": \"ed@sencha.com\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 2,\n            \"name\": \"Abe Elias\",\n            \"email\": \"abe@sencha.com\"\n        }\n    ]\n\n## Reading other JSON formats\n\nIf you already have your JSON format defined and it doesn't look quite like what we have above, you can usually\npass JsonReader a couple of configuration options to make it parse your format. For example, we can use the\n{@link #cfg!rootProperty #cfg-rootProperty} configuration to parse data that comes back like this:\n\n    {\n        \"users\": [\n           {\n               \"id\": 1,\n               \"name\": \"Ed Spencer\",\n               \"email\": \"ed@sencha.com\"\n           },\n           {\n               \"id\": 2,\n               \"name\": \"Abe Elias\",\n               \"email\": \"abe@sencha.com\"\n           }\n        ]\n    }\n\nTo parse this we just pass in a {@link #cfg!rootProperty #rootProperty} configuration that matches the 'users' above:\n\n    reader: {\n        type: 'json',\n        rootProperty: 'users'\n    }\n\nSometimes the JSON structure is even more complicated. Document databases like CouchDB often provide metadata\naround each record inside a nested structure like this:\n\n    {\n        \"total\": 122,\n        \"offset\": 0,\n        \"users\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"ed-spencer-1\",\n                \"value\": 1,\n                \"user\": {\n                    \"id\": 1,\n                    \"name\": \"Ed Spencer\",\n                    \"email\": \"ed@sencha.com\"\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n\nIn the case above the record data is nested an additional level inside the \"users\" array as each \"user\" item has\nadditional metadata surrounding it ('id' and 'value' in this case). To parse data out of each \"user\" item in the\nJSON above we need to specify the {@link #cfg!record #record} configuration like this:\n\n    reader: {\n        type  : 'json',\n        rootProperty  : 'users',\n        record: 'user'\n    }\n\n## Response MetaData\n\nThe server can return metadata in its response, in addition to the record data, that describe attributes\nof the data set itself or are used to reconfigure the Reader. To pass metadata in the response you simply\nadd a `{@link #property!metaData metaData}` attribute to the root of the response data. The metaData attribute can contain anything,\nbut supports a specific set of properties that are handled by the Reader if they are present:\n\n- {@link #cfg!rootProperty #rootProperty}: the property name of the root response node containing the record data\n- {@link #cfg!totalProperty #totalProperty}: property name for the total number of records in the data\n- {@link #cfg!successProperty #successProperty}: property name for the success status of the response\n- {@link #cfg!messageProperty #messageProperty}: property name for an optional response message\n- {@link Ext.data.Model#cfg!fields fields}: Config used to reconfigure the Model's fields before converting the\nresponse data into records\n\nAn initial Reader configuration containing all of these properties might look like this (\"fields\" would be\nincluded in the Model definition, not shown):\n\n    reader: {\n        type : 'json',\n        rootProperty : 'root',\n        totalProperty  : 'total',\n        successProperty: 'success',\n        messageProperty: 'message'\n    }\n\nIf you were to pass a response object containing attributes different from those initially defined above, you could\nuse the `{@link #property!metaData metaData}` attribute to reconfigure the Reader on the fly. For example:\n\n    {\n        \"count\": 1,\n        \"ok\": true,\n        \"msg\": \"Users found\",\n        \"users\": [{\n            \"userId\": 123,\n            \"name\": \"Ed Spencer\",\n            \"email\": \"ed@sencha.com\"\n        }],\n        \"metaData\": {\n            \"rootProperty\": \"users\",\n            \"totalProperty\": 'count',\n            \"successProperty\": 'ok',\n            \"messageProperty\": 'msg'\n        }\n    }\n\nYou can also place any other arbitrary data you need into the `{@link #property!metaData metaData}` attribute which will be ignored by the Reader,\nbut will be accessible via the Reader's {@link #property!metaData #metaData} property (which is also passed to listeners via the Proxy's\n{@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy#event!metachange metachange} event (also relayed by the store). Application code can then\nprocess the passed metadata in any way it chooses.\n\nA simple example for how this can be used would be customizing the fields for a Model that is bound to a grid. By passing\nthe `fields` property the Model will be automatically updated by the Reader internally, but that change will not be\nreflected automatically in the grid unless you also update the column configuration. You could do this manually, or you\ncould simply pass a standard grid {@link Ext.panel.Table#columns column} config object as part of the `{@link #property!metaData metaData}` attribute\nand then pass that along to the grid. Here's a very simple example for how that could be accomplished:\n\n    // response format:\n    {\n        ...\n        \"metaData\": {\n            \"fields\": [\n                { \"name\": \"userId\", \"type\": \"int\" },\n                { \"name\": \"name\", \"type\": \"string\" },\n                { \"name\": \"birthday\", \"type\": \"date\", \"dateFormat\": \"Y-j-m\" },\n            ],\n            \"columns\": [\n                { \"text\": \"User ID\", \"dataIndex\": \"userId\", \"width\": 40 },\n                { \"text\": \"User Name\", \"dataIndex\": \"name\", \"flex\": 1 },\n                { \"text\": \"Birthday\", \"dataIndex\": \"birthday\", \"flex\": 1, \"format\": 'Y-j-m', \"xtype\": \"datecolumn\" }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n\nThe Reader will automatically read the meta fields config and rebuild the Model based on the new fields, but to handle\nthe new column configuration you would need to handle the metadata within the application code. This is done simply enough\nby handling the metachange event on either the store or the proxy, e.g.:\n\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        ...\n        listeners: {\n            'metachange': function(store, meta) {\n                myGrid.reconfigure(store, meta.columns);\n            }\n        }\n    });\n",

First we'll define the models:\n\n    Ext.define(\"User\", {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            'id', 'name'\n        ],\n\n        hasMany: {model: 'Order', name: 'orders'},\n\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'rest',\n            url : 'users.json',\n            reader: {\n                type: 'json',\n                rootProperty: 'users'\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.define(\"Order\", {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            'id', 'total'\n        ],\n\n        hasMany  : {model: 'OrderItem', name: 'orderItems', associationKey: 'order_items'},\n        belongsTo: 'User'\n    });\n\n    Ext.define(\"OrderItem\", {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            'id', 'price', 'quantity', 'order_id', 'product_id'\n        ],\n\n        belongsTo: ['Order', {model: 'Product', associationKey: 'product'}]\n    });\n\n    Ext.define(\"Product\", {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            'id', 'name'\n        ],\n\n        hasMany: 'OrderItem'\n    });\n\nThis may be a lot to take in - basically a User has many Orders, each of which is composed of several OrderItems.\nFinally, each OrderItem has a single Product. This allows us to consume data like this:\n\n    {\n        \"users\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": 123,\n                \"name\": \"Ed\",\n                \"orders\": [\n                    {\n                        \"id\": 50,\n                        \"total\": 100,\n                        \"order_items\": [\n                            {\n                                \"id\"      : 20,\n                                \"price\"   : 40,\n                                \"quantity\": 2,\n                                \"product\" : {\n                                    \"id\": 1000,\n                                    \"name\": \"MacBook Pro\"\n                                }\n                            },\n                            {\n                                \"id\"      : 21,\n                                \"price\"   : 20,\n                                \"quantity\": 3,\n                                \"product\" : {\n                                    \"id\": 1001,\n                                    \"name\": \"iPhone\"\n                                }\n                            }\n                        ]\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n\nThe JSON response is deeply nested - it returns all Users (in this case just 1 for simplicity's sake), all of the\nOrders for each User (again just 1 in this case), all of the OrderItems for each Order (2 order items in this case),\nand finally the Product associated with each OrderItem. Now we can read the data and use it as follows:\n\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: \"User\"\n    });\n\n    store.load({\n        callback: function() {\n            //the user that was loaded\n            var user = store.first();\n\n            console.log(\"Orders for \" + user.get('name') + \":\")\n\n            //iterate over the Orders for each User\n            user.orders().each(function(order) {\n                console.log(\"Order ID: \" + order.getId() + \", which contains items:\");\n\n                //iterate over the OrderItems for each Order\n                order.orderItems().each(function(orderItem) {\n                    //we know that the Product data is already loaded, so we can use the synchronous getProduct\n                    //usually, we would use the asynchronous version (see #belongsTo)\n                    var product = orderItem.getProduct();\n\n                    console.log(orderItem.get('quantity') + ' orders of ' + product.get('name'));\n                });\n            });\n        }\n    });\n\nRunning the code above results in the following:\n\n    Orders for Ed:\n    Order ID: 50, which contains items:\n    2 orders of MacBook Pro\n    3 orders of iPhone\n",

Then the XML Reader uses the configured {@link #cfg!record #record} option to pull out the data for each record -\nin this case we set record to 'user', so each `<user>` above will be converted into a User model.\n\nNote that XmlReader doesn't care whether your {@link #cfg!rootProperty #rootProperty} and {@link #cfg!record #record} elements are nested deep inside a\nlarger structure, so a response like this will still work:\n\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <deeply>\n        <nested>\n            <xml>\n                <users>\n                    <user>\n                        <id>1</id>\n                        <name>Ed Spencer</name>\n                        <email>ed@sencha.com</email>\n                    </user>\n                    <user>\n                        <id>2</id>\n                        <name>Abe Elias</name>\n                        <email>abe@sencha.com</email>\n                    </user>\n                </users>\n            </xml>\n        </nested>\n    </deeply>\n\nIf this Reader is being used by a {@link Ext.data.TreeStore} to read tree-structured data in which records\nare nested as descendant nodes of other records, then this lenient behaviour must be overridden by using a more specific\nchild node selector as your {@link #cfg!record #record} selector which will not select all descendants, such as:\n\n   record: '>user'\n\n# Response metadata\n\nThe server can return additional data in its response, such as the {@link #cfg!totalProperty total number of records} and\nthe {@link #cfg!successProperty success status of the response}. These are typically included in the XML response like\nthis:\n\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <users>\n        <total>100</total>\n        <success>true</success>\n        <user>\n            <id>1</id>\n            <name>Ed Spencer</name>\n            <email>ed@sencha.com</email>\n        </user>\n        <user>\n            <id>2</id>\n            <name>Abe Elias</name>\n            <email>abe@sencha.com</email>\n        </user>\n    </users>\n\nIf these properties are present in the XML response they can be parsed out by the XmlReader and used by the Store\nthat loaded it. We can set up the names of these properties by specifying a final pair of configuration options:\n\n    reader: {\n        type: 'xml',\n        rootProperty: 'users',\n        totalProperty  : 'total',\n        successProperty: 'success'\n    }\n\nThese final options are not necessary to make the Reader work, but can be useful when the server needs to report an\nerror or if it needs to indicate that there is a lot of data available of which only a subset is currently being\nreturned.\n\n# Response format\n\n**Note:** in order for the browser to parse a returned XML document, the Content-Type header in the HTTP response\nmust be set to \"text/xml\" or \"application/xml\". This is very important - the XmlReader will not work correctly\notherwise.\n",

        "doc": "**This class is never created directly. It should be constructed through associations in `{@link Ext.data.Model}`.**\n\nAssociations enable you to express relationships between different {@link Ext.data.Model}. Consider\nan ecommerce system where Users can place Orders - there is a one to many relationship between these Models,\none user can have many orders (including 0 orders). Here is what a sample implementation of this association\ncould look like. This example will be referred to in the following sections.\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'id',\n            type: 'int'\n        }, 'name']\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('Order', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'id',\n            type: 'int'\n        }, {\n            name: 'userId',\n            type: 'int',\n            reference: 'User'\n        }]\n    });\n\n# Association Types\n\nAssocations can describe relationships in 3 ways:\n\n## Many To One\n\nA single entity (`A`) has a relationship with many (`B`) entities. An example of this is\nan ecommerce system `User` can have many `Order` entities.\n\nThis can be defined using `{@link Ext.data.schema.ManyToOne}` for keyed associations, or\n`{@link Ext.data.schema.HasMany}` for keyless associations.\n\n## One To One\n\nA less common form of Many To One, a single entity (`A`) has a relationship with at most 1 entity (`B`). This is often\nused when partitioning data. For example a `User` may have a single `UserInfo` object that stores extra\nmetadata about the user.\n\nThis can be defined using `{@link Ext.data.schema.OneToOne}` for keyed associations, or\n`{@link Ext.data.schema.HasOne}` for keyless associations.\n\n## Many To Many\n\nAn entity (`A`) may have a have a relationship with many (`B`) entities. That (`B`) entity may also\nhave a relationship with many `A` entities. For example a single `Student` can have many `Subject` entities and\na single `Subject` can have many `Student` entities.\n\nThis can be defined using `{@link Ext.data.schema.ManyToMany}`. Many To Many relationships are readonly unless used with\na `{@link Ext.data.Session}`.\n\n\n# Keyed vs Keyless Associations\n\nAssociations can be declared in 2 ways, which are outlined below.\n\n## Keyed associations\n\nA keyed association relies on a field in the model matching the id of another model. Membership is driven by the key.\nThis is the type of relationship that is typically used in a relational database.\nThis is declared using the ||reference|| configuration on a model field. An example of this can be seen\nabove for `User/Order`.\n\n# Keyless associations\n\nA keyless association relies on data hierarchy to determine membership. Items are members because they are\ncontained by another entity. This type of relationship is common with NoSQL databases.\nformats. A simple example definition using `User/Order`:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'id',\n            type: 'int'\n        }, 'name'],\n        hasMany: 'Order'\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('Order', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'id',\n            type: 'int'\n        }]\n    });\n\n# Advantages of Associations\nAssocations make it easier to work with Models that share a connection. Some of the main functionality includes:\n\n## Generated Accessors/Setters\n\nAssociated models will automatically generate named methods that allow for accessing the associated data.\nThe names for these are created using a {@link Ext.data.schema.Schema}, to provide a consistent and\npredictable naming structure.\n\nUsing the example code above, there will be 3 generated methods:\n+ `User` will have an `orders()` function that returns a `{@link Ext.data.Store}` of`Orders`.\n+ `Order` will have a `getUser` method which will return a `User` Model.\n+ `Order` will have a `setUser` method that will accept a `User` model or a key value.\n\n## Nested Loading\n\nNested loading is the ability to load hierarchical associated data from a remote source within a single request.\nIn the following example, each `User` in the `users` store has an `orders` store. Each `orders` store is populated\nwith `Order` models read from the request. Each `Order` model also has a reference back to the appropriate `User`.\n\n    // Sample JSON data returned by /Users\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"name\": \"User Foo\",\n        \"orders\": [{\n            \"id\": 101,\n            \"userId\": 1\n        }, {\n            \"id\": 102,\n            \"userId\": 1\n        }, {\n            \"id\": 103,\n            \"userId\": 1\n        }]\n    }, {\n        \"id\": 2,\n        \"name\": \"User Bar\",\n        \"orders\": [{\n            \"id\": 201,\n            \"userId\": 2\n        }, {\n            \"id\": 202,\n            \"userId\": 2\n        }]\n    }]\n\n    // Application code\n    var users = new Ext.data.Store({\n        model: 'User',\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'ajax',\n            url: '/Users'\n        }\n    });\n    users.load(function() {\n        var user1 = users.first(),\n            user2 = users.last(),\n            orders1 = user1.orders(),\n            orders2 = user2.orders();\n\n        // 3 orders, same reference back to user1\n        console.log(orders1.getCount(), orders1.first().getUser() === user1);\n        // 2 orders, same reference back to user2\n        console.log(orders2.getCount(), orders2.first().getUser() === user2);\n    });\n\n## Binding\n\nData binding using {@link Ext.app.ViewModel} have functionality to be able to recognize\nassociated data as part of a bind statement. For example:\n+ `{user.orders}` binds to the orders store for a user.\n+ `{order.user.name}` binds to the name of the user taken from the order.\n\n\n# Association Concepts\n\n## Roles\n\nThe role is used to determine generated names for an association. By default, the role is generated from\neither the field name (in a keyed association) or the model name. This naming follows a pattern defined by\nthe `{@link Ext.data.schema.Namer}`. To change a specific instance, an explicit role can be specified:\n\n    Ext.define('Thread', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'title']\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('Post', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'content', {\n            name: 'threadId',\n            reference: {\n                type: 'Thread',\n                role: 'discussion',\n                inverse: 'comments'\n\n            }\n        }]\n    });\n\nIn the above example, the `Thread` will be decorated with a `comments` method that returns the store.\nThe `Post` will be decorated with `getDiscussion/setDiscussion` methods.\n\n## Generated Methods\n\nAssociations generate methods to allow reading and manipulation on associated data.\n\nOn records that have a \"to many\" relationship, a single methods that returns a `{@link Ext.data.Store}` is created.\nSee {@link #method!storeGetter #storeGetter}. On records that have a \"to one\" relationship, 2 methods are generated, a\n{@link #method!recordGetter getter} and a {@link #method!recordSetter setter}.\n\n## Reflexive\n\nAssociations are reflexive. By declaring one \"side\" of the relationship, the other is automatically setup. In\nthe example below, there is no code in the `Thread` entity regarding the association, however by virtue of the\ndeclaration in post, `Thread` is decorated with the appropriate infrastructure to participate in the association.\n\n    Ext.define('Thread', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'title']\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('Post', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'content', {\n            name: 'threadId',\n            reference: 'Thread'\n        }]\n    });\n\n## Naming\n\nReferring to model names in associations depends on their {@link Ext.data.Model#property!entityName Ext.data.Model#entityName}. See\nthe \"Relative Naming\" section in the `{@link Ext.data.schema.Schema}` documentation.\n",

        "type": "Ext.data.schema.Schema",
        "doc": "A Schema is a collection of related {@link Ext.data.Model} and their respective\n{@link Ext.data.schema.Association}.\n\n# Schema Instances\n\nBy default a single instance of this class is created which serves as the schema for all\nentities that do not have an explicit `{@link Ext.data.Model#cfg!schema schema}` config\neither specified or inherited. This is sufficient in most cases.\n\nWhen an entity does specify a `{@link Ext.data.Model#cfg!schema schema}`, however, that\nlooks up (or creates) an instance for that entity class which is then inherited.\n\n**Important:** All related entities *must* belong to a single schema instance in order\nto properly link up their associations.\n\n## Configuring Schemas\n\nThe best way to control the configuration of your `schema` is to define a base class for\nall of your entities and use the `{@link Ext.data.Model#cfg!schema schema}` config like\nthis:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.model.Base', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n\n         // This configures the default schema because we don't assign an \"id\":\n         schema: {\n             // configs go here\n         }\n     });\n\n**Note:** Only one explicit configuration can be applied to the default schema. In most\napplications this will not be an issue.\n\nBy using a base class for your entities you can ensure that the default schema is fully\nconfigured before declaration of your classes proceeds. This is especially helpful if\nyou need to set the `{@link #cfg!namespace namespace}` for your schema (see below).\n\n## Relative Naming\n\nWhen describing associations between entities, it is desirable to use shorthand names\nthat do not contain the common namespace portion. This is called the `entityName` as\nopposed to its class name. By default, the `entityName` is the full class name. However,\nif a namespace is used, the common portion can be discarded and we can derive a shorter name.\nIn the following code, `\"MyApp.model.Foo\"` has an `entityName` of `\"Foo\"` and the schema has\na `{@link #cfg!namespace namespace}` of \"MyApp.model\".\n\nIf you use deeper nesting for entities, you may need to set the `{@link #cfg!namespace namespace}` config to\naccount for this. For example:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.model.Base', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n\n         schema: {\n             namespace: 'MyApp.model'\n         }\n     });\n\nYour derived classes now will generate proper default `entityName` values even if they\nhave further namespaces. For example, \"MyApp.model.foo.Thing\" will produce \"foo.Thing\"\nas the `entityName` given the above as a base class.\n\n# Association Naming\n\nThere are various terms involved when describing associations. Perhaps the simplest\nexample that will clarify these terms is that of the common many-to-many association\nof User and Group.\n\n  * `entityName` - The names \"User\" and \"Group\" are the `entityName` values associated\n  with these two classes. These are derived from their full classnames (perhaps\n  something like \"App.model.User\" and \"App.model.Group\").\n\n  * `associationName` - When talking about associations, especially the many-to-many\n  variety, it is important to give them names. Associations are not owned by either of\n  the entities involved, so this name is similar to an `entityName`. In the case of\n  \"User\" and \"Group\", the default `associationName` would be \"GroupUsers\".\n\n  * `left` and `right` - Associations describe a relationship between two entities. To\n  talk about specific associations we would use the `entityName` of the parties (such\n  as \"User\" or \"Group\"). When discussing associations in the abstract, however, it is\n  very helpful to be able to talk about the entities in an association in a general way.\n  In the case of the \"GroupUsers\" association, \"User\" is said to be the `left` while\n  \"Group\" is said to be the `right`. In a many-to-many association the selection of\n  `left` and `right` is arbitrary. When a foreign-key is involved, the `left` entity\n  is the one containing the foreign-key.\n\n## Custom Naming Conventions\n\nOne of the jobs the the `Schema` is to manage name generation (such as `entityName`).\nThis job is delegated to a class called the `{@link #cfg!namer namer}`. If you need to generate names in\nother ways, you can provide a custom `{@link #cfg!namer namer}` for your classes:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.model.Base', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n\n         schema: {\n             namespace: 'MyApp.model',\n             namer: 'custom'\n         }\n     });\n\nThis will create a class using the alias \"namer.custom\". For example:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.model.CustomNamer', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.schema.Namer',\n\n         alias: 'namer.custom',\n         ...\n     });\n\nFor details see the documentation for {@link Ext.data.schema.Namer}.\n",

This often starts by loading records when requested (via\nbind - see below) and culminates when it is time to save to the server.\n\nBecause the Session tracks all records it loads, it ensures that for any given type of\nmodel, only one record exists with a given `id`. This means that all edits of that\nrecord are properly targeted at that one instance.\n\nSimilarly, when associations are loaded, the `{@link Ext.data.Store}` created to hold the\nassociated records is tracked by the Session. So all requests for the \"OrderItems\" of\na particular Order id will result in the same Store. Adding and removing items from\nthat Order then is sure to remain consistent.\n\n# Data\n\nSince the Session is managing all this data, there are several methods it provides\nto give convenient access to that data. The most important of these is `{@link #method!update update}` and\n`{@link #method!getChanges getChanges}`.\n\nThe `{@link #method!update update}` and `{@link #method!getChanges getChanges}` methods both operate on object that contains a summary\nof records and associations and different CRUD operations.\n\n## Saving\n\nThere are two basic ways to save the contents of a Session: `{@link #method!getChanges getChanges}` and\n`{@link #method!getSaveBatch getSaveBatch}`.

The data contained in the CRUD object\ncan be translated into whatever shape is needed by the server.\n\nTo leverage the `{@link Ext.data.Model#cfg!proxy proxy}` facilities defined by each Model\nclass, there is the `{@link #method!getSaveBatch getSaveBatch}` method. That method returns an `{@link Ext.data.Batch}`\nobject populated with the necessary `{@link #static-method!create create}`, `{@link #method!update update}` and `destory` operations to\nsave all of the changes in the Session.\n",

Stores load data via a\n{@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy}, and also provide functions for {@link #method!sort sorting}, {@link #method!filter filtering}\nand querying the {@link Ext.data.Model} instances contained within it.\n\nCreating a Store is easy - we just tell it the Model and the Proxy to use for loading and saving its data:\n\n     // Set up a model to use in our Store\n     Ext.define('User', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n         fields: [\n             {name: 'firstName', type: 'string'},\n             {name: 'lastName',  type: 'string'},\n             {name: 'age',       type: 'int'},\n             {name: 'eyeColor',  type: 'string'}\n         ]\n     });\n\n     var myStore = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n         model: 'User',\n         proxy: {\n             type: 'ajax',\n             url: '/users.json',\n             reader: {\n                 type: 'json',\n                 rootProperty: 'users'\n             }\n         },\n         autoLoad: true\n     });\n\nIn the example above we configured an AJAX proxy to load data from the url '/users.json'. We told our Proxy to use a\n{@link Ext.data.reader.Json} to parse the response from the server into Model object - {@link Ext.data.reader.Json} for details.\n\n## Inline data\n\nStores can also load data inline. Internally, Store converts each of the objects we pass in as {@link #cfg!data #cfg-data} into\nModel instances:\n\n     Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n         model: 'User',\n         data : [\n             {firstName: 'Peter',   lastName: 'Venkman'},\n             {firstName: 'Egon',    lastName: 'Spengler'},\n             {firstName: 'Ray',     lastName: 'Stantz'},\n             {firstName: 'Winston', lastName: 'Zeddemore'}\n         ]\n     });\n\nLoading inline data using the method above is great if the data is in the correct format already (e.g. it doesn't\nneed to be processed by a {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader}). If your inline data requires processing to decode\nthe data structure, use a {@link Ext.data.proxy.Memory} instead (see the {@link Ext.data.proxy.Memory} docs for an example).\n\nAdditional data can also be loaded locally using {@link #method!add #method-add}.\n\n## Dynamic Loading\n\nStores can be dynamically updated by calling the {@link #method!load #method-load} method:\n\n    store.load({\n        params: {\n            group: 3,\n            type: 'user'\n        },\n        callback: function(records, operation, success) {\n            // do something after the load finishes\n        },\n        scope: this\n    });\n\nHere a bunch of arbitrary parameters is passed along with the load request and a callback function is set\nup to do something after the loading is over.\n\n## Loading Nested Data\n\nApplications often need to load sets of associated data - for example a CRM system might load a User and her Orders.\nInstead of issuing an AJAX request for the User and a series of additional AJAX requests for each Order, we can load\na nested dataset and allow the Reader to automatically populate the associated models. Below is a brief example, see\nthe {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader} intro docs for a full explanation:\n\n     var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n         autoLoad: true,\n         model: \"User\",\n         proxy: {\n             type: 'ajax',\n             url: 'users.json',\n             reader: {\n                 type: 'json',\n                 rootProperty: 'users'\n             }\n         }\n     });\n\nWhich would consume a response like this:\n\n     {\n         \"users\": [{\n             \"id\": 1,\n             \"name\": \"Peter\",\n             \"orders\": [{\n                 \"id\": 10,\n                 \"total\": 10.76,\n                 \"status\": \"invoiced\"\n            },{\n                 \"id\": 11,\n                 \"total\": 13.45,\n                 \"status\": \"shipped\"\n            }]\n         }]\n     }\n\nSee the {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader} intro docs for a full explanation.\n\n## Filtering and Sorting\n\nStores can be sorted and filtered - in both cases either remotely or locally. The {@link #cfg!sorters #cfg-sorters} and\n{@link #cfg!filters #cfg-filters} are held inside {@link Ext.util.Collection} instances to make them easy to manage.\nUsually it is sufficient to either just specify sorters and filters in the Store configuration or call {@link #method!sort #method-sort}\nor {@link #method!filter #filter}:\n\n     var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n         model: 'User',\n         sorters: [{\n             property: 'age',\n             direction: 'DESC'\n         }, {\n             property: 'firstName',\n             direction: 'ASC'\n         }],\n\n         filters: [{\n             property: 'firstName',\n             value: /Peter/\n         }]\n     });\n\nThe new Store will keep the configured sorters and filters in the Collection instances mentioned above. By\ndefault, sorting and filtering are both performed locally by the Store - see {@link #cfg!remoteSort #remoteSort} and\n{@link #cfg!remoteFilter #remoteFilter} to allow the server to perform these operations instead.\n\nFiltering and sorting after the Store has been instantiated is also easy. Calling {@link #method!filter #filter} adds another filter\nto the Store and automatically filters the dataset (calling {@link #method!filter #filter} with no arguments simply re-applies all\nexisting filters).\n\n    store.filter('eyeColor', 'Brown');\n\nChange the sorting at any time by calling {@link #method!sort #method-sort}:\n\n    store.sort('height', 'ASC');\n\nNote that all existing sorters will be removed in favor of the new sorter data (if {@link #method!sort #method-sort} is called with no\narguments, the existing sorters are just reapplied instead of being removed). To keep existing sorters and add new\nones, just add them to the Collection:\n\n    store.sorters.add(new Ext.util.Sorter({\n        property : 'shoeSize',\n        direction: 'ASC'\n    }));\n\n    store.sort();\n\n## Registering with StoreManager\n\nAny Store that is instantiated with a {@link #cfg!storeId #storeId} will automatically be registered with the {@link Ext.data.StoreManager}. This makes it easy to reuse the same store in multiple views:\n\n    //this store can be used several times\n    Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: 'User',\n        storeId: 'usersStore'\n    });\n\n    new Ext.List({\n        store: 'usersStore',\n        //other config goes here\n    });\n\n    new Ext.view.View({\n        store: 'usersStore',\n        //other config goes here\n    });\n\n## Further Reading\n\nStores are backed up by an ecosystem of classes that enables their operation. To gain a full understanding of these\npieces and how they fit together, see:\n\n  - {@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy} - overview of what Proxies are and how they are used\n  - {@link Ext.data.Model} - the core class in the data package\n  - {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader} - used by any subclass of {@link Ext.data.proxy.Server} to read a response\n",

These fields are listed\nin the {@link Ext.data.NodeInterface} documentation.\n\n# Reading Nested Data\n\nFor the tree to read nested data, the {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader} must be configured with a root property,\nso the reader can find nested data for each node (if a root is not specified, it will default to\n'children'). This will tell the tree to look for any nested tree nodes by the same keyword, i.e., 'children'.\nIf a root is specified in the config make sure that any nested nodes with children have the same name.\n\n**Note:** Setting {@link #cfg!defaultRootProperty #defaultRootProperty} accomplishes the same thing.\n\n#rootProperty as a Function\nYou can pass a function as the data reader's rootProperty when the tree's dataset has\nmixed root properties. Child nodes can then be programmatically determined at read time.\n\nFor example, the child nodes may be passed via the 'children' property\nname, though you may have a top-level root property of 'items'.\n\nSee {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader#cfg!rootProperty rootProperty} for more information.\n\n#Filtering#\nFiltering of nodes in a TreeStore is hierarchically top down by default. This means that if a non-leaf node does not\npass the filter, then it, and all its descendants are filtered *out* of the store.\n\nTo reverse this, so that any node which passes the filter causes all its ancestors to be visible, configure\nthe `TreeStore` with '{@link #cfg!filterer filterer: 'bottomup'}`\n\nYou may also programatically filter individual tree nodes by setting their `'visible'` field.\n\nSetting this to `false` filters the node out so that it will not appear in the UI.

        "type": "Ext.dataview.DataView",
        "doc": "DataView makes it easy to create lots of components dynamically, usually based off a {@link Ext.data.Store}.\nIt's great for rendering lots of data from your server backend or any other data source and is what powers\ncomponents like {@link Ext.dataview.List Ext.List}.\n\nUse DataView whenever you want to show sets of the same component many times, for examples in apps like these:\n\n- List of messages in an email app\n- Showing latest news/tweets\n- Tiled set of albums in an HTML5 music player\n\n# Creating a Simple DataView\n\nAt its simplest, a DataView is just a Store full of data and a simple template that we use to render each item:\n\n    @example miniphone preview\n    var gbTeam = Ext.create('Ext.DataView', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        store: {\n            fields: ['name', 'age'],\n            data: [\n                {name: 'Peter',  age: 26},\n                {name: 'Ray',   age: 21},\n                {name: 'Egon', age: 24},\n                {name: 'Winston', age: 24}\n            ]\n        },\n\n        itemTpl: '<div>{name} is {age} years old</div>'\n    });\n\nHere we just defined everything inline so it's all local with nothing being loaded from a server. For each of the 5\ndata items defined in our Store, DataView will render a {@link Ext.Component} and pass in the name and age\ndata. The component will use the tpl we provided above, rendering the data in the curly bracket placeholders we\nprovided.\n\nBecause DataView is integrated with Store, any changes to the Store are immediately reflected on the screen. For\nexample, if we add a new record to the Store it will be rendered into our DataView:\n\n    gbTeam.getStore().add({\n        name: 'Gozer',\n        age: 567\n    });\n\nWe didn't have to manually update the DataView, it's just automatically updated. The same happens if we modify one\nof the existing records in the Store:\n\n    gbTeam.getStore().getAt(0).set('age', 42);\n\nThis will get the first record in the Store (Peter), change the age to 42 and automatically update what's on the\nscreen.\n\n    @example miniphone\n    var gbTeam = Ext.create('Ext.DataView', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        store: {\n            fields: ['name', 'age'],\n            data: [\n                {name: 'Peter',  age: 26},\n                {name: 'Ray',   age: 21},\n                {name: 'Egon', age: 24},\n                {name: 'Winston', age: 24}\n            ]\n        },\n\n        itemTpl: '<div>{name} is {age} years old</div>'\n    });\n\n    gbTeam.getStore().add({\n        name: 'Gozer',\n        age: 21\n    });\n\n    gbTeam.getStore().getAt(0).set('age', 42);\n\n# Loading data from a server\n\nWe often want to load data from our server or some other web service so that we don't have to hard code it all\nlocally. Let's say we want to load some horror movies from Rotten Tomatoes into a DataView, and for each one\nrender the cover image and title. To do this all we have to do is grab an api key from rotten tomatoes (http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/)\nand modify the {@link #cfg!store #store} and {@link #cfg!itemTpl #itemTpl} a little:\n\n    @example portrait\n    Ext.create('Ext.DataView', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        store: {\n            autoLoad: true,\n            fields: ['id', 'title',\n             {\n                 name:'thumbnail_image',\n                 convert: function(v, record) {return record.raw.posters.thumbnail; }\n             }],\n\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'jsonp',\n                // Modify this line with your API key, pretty please...\n                url: 'http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies.json?apikey=hbjgfgryw8tygxztr5wtag3u&q=Horror',\n\n                reader: {\n                    type: 'json',\n                    rootProperty: 'results'\n                }\n            }\n        },\n\n        itemTpl: '<img src=\"{thumbnail_image}\" /><p>{title}</p><div style=\"clear: both\"></div>'\n    });\n\nThe Store no longer has hard coded data, instead we've provided a {@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy}, which fetches\nthe data for us. In this case we used a JSON-P proxy so that we can load from Twitter's JSON-P search API. We also\nspecified the fields present for each tweet, and used Store's {@link Ext.data.Store#cfg!autoLoad autoLoad} configuration\nto load automatically. Finally, we configured a Reader to decode the response from Twitter, telling it to expect\nJSON and that the tweets can be found in the 'results' part of the JSON response.\n\nThe last thing we did is update our template to render the image, Twitter username and message. All we need to do\nnow is add a little CSS to style the list the way we want it and we end up with a very basic Twitter viewer. Click\nthe preview button on the example above to see it in action.\n",

        "type": "Ext.Decorator",
        "doc": "\nIn a few words, a Decorator is a Component that wraps around another Component. A typical example of a Decorator is a\n{@link Ext.field.Field}. A form field is nothing more than a decorator around another component, and gives the\ncomponent a label, as well as extra styling to make it look good in a form.\n\nA Decorator can be thought of as a lightweight Container that has only one child item, and no layout overhead.\nThe look and feel of decorators can be styled purely in CSS.\n\nAnother powerful feature that Decorator provides is config proxying. For example: all config items of a\n{@link Ext.slider.Slider} also exist in a {@link Ext.field.Slider} for API convenience.\nThe {@link Ext.field.Slider} simply proxies all corresponding getters and setters\nto the actual {@link Ext.slider.Slider} instance. Writing out all the setters and getters to do that is a tedious task\nand a waste of code space. Instead, when you sub-class Ext.Decorator, all you need to do is to specify those config items\nthat you want to proxy to the Component using a special 'proxyConfig' class property. Here's how it may look like\nin a Slider Field class:\n\n    Ext.define('My.field.Slider', {\n        extend: 'Ext.Decorator',\n\n        config: {\n            component: {\n                xtype: 'slider'\n            }\n        },\n\n        proxyConfig: {\n            minValue: 0,\n            maxValue: 100,\n            increment: 1\n        }\n\n        // ...\n    });\n\nOnce `My.field.Slider` class is created, it will have all setters and getters methods for all items listed in `proxyConfig`\nautomatically generated. These methods all proxy to the same method names that exist within the Component instance.\n",

    "Ext.Deferred": {
        "type": "Ext.Deferred",
        "doc": "Deferreds are the mechanism used to create new Promises. A Deferred has a single\nassociated Promise that can be safely returned to external consumers to ensure they do\nnot interfere with the resolution or rejection of the deferred operation.\n\nThis implementation of Promises is an extension of the ECMAScript 6 Promises API as\ndetailed [here][1]. For a compatible, though less full featured, API see `{@link Ext.Promise}`.\n\nA Deferred is typically used within the body of a function that performs an asynchronous\noperation. When that operation succeeds, the Deferred should be resolved; if that\noperation fails, the Deferred should be rejected.\n\nEach Deferred has an associated Promise. A Promise delegates `{@link #method!then then}` calls to its\nDeferred's `{@link #method!then then}` method. In this way, access to Deferred operations are divided between\nproducer (Deferred) and consumer (Promise) roles.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nIn it's most common form, a method will create and return a Promise like this:\n\n     // A method in a service class which uses a Store and returns a Promise\n     //\n     loadCompanies: function () {\n         var deferred = new Ext.Deferred(); // create the Ext.Deferred object\n\n         this.companyStore.load({\n             callback: function (records, operation, success) {\n                 if (success) {\n                     // Use \"deferred\" to drive the promise:\n                     deferred.resolve(records);\n                 }\n                 else {\n                     // Use \"deferred\" to drive the promise:\n                     deferred.reject(\"Error loading Companies.\");\n                 }\n             }\n         });\n\n         return deferred.promise;  // return the Promise to the caller\n     }\n\nYou can see this method first creates a `{@link Ext.Deferred}` object. It then\nreturns its `Promise` object for use by the caller. Finally, in the asynchronous\ncallback, it resolves the `deferred` object if the call was successful, and rejects the\n`deferred` if the call failed.\n\nWhen a Deferred's `{@link #method!resolve resolve}` method is called, it fulfills with the optionally specified\nvalue. If `{@link #method!resolve resolve}` is called with a then-able (i.e.a Function or Object with a `{@link #method!then then}`\nfunction, such as another Promise) it assimilates the then-able's result; the Deferred\nprovides its own `{@link #method!resolve resolve}` and `{@link #method!reject reject}` methods as the onFulfilled or onRejected\narguments in a call to that then-able's `{@link #method!then then}` function. If an error is thrown while\ncalling the then-able's `{@link #method!then then}` function (prior to any call back to the specified\n`{@link #method!resolve resolve}` or `{@link #method!reject reject}` methods), the Deferred rejects with that error. If a Deferred's\n`{@link #method!resolve resolve}` method is called with its own Promise, it rejects with a TypeError.\n\nWhen a Deferred's `{@link #method!reject reject}` method is called, it rejects with the optionally specified\nreason.\n\nEach time a Deferred's `{@link #method!then then}` method is called, it captures a pair of optional\nonFulfilled and onRejected callbacks and returns a Promise of the Deferred's future\nvalue as transformed by those callbacks.\n\nSee `{@link Ext.promise.Promise}` for an example of using the returned Promise.\n",

        "doc": "\n <p>The {@link Ext.direct.AmfRemotingProvider}\n allows making RPC calls to a Java object on a BlazeDS or ColdFusion using either the AMFX or the AMF protocols.</p>\n\n <p>The default protocol is AMFX which works on all browsers. If you choose AMF, a flash plugin might be loaded in certain browsers that do not support posting binary data to the server, e.g. Internet Explorer version 9 or less. To choose AMF, set the {@link Ext.direct.AmfRemotingProvider#cfg!binary binary} property to true.</p>\n <p>For AMFX, the server must be configured to expose the desired services via an HTTPEndpoint. For example, the following configuration snippet adds an HTTPEndpoint (AMFX endpoint) to the BlazeDS services-config.xml file:</p>\n <pre><code>\n&lt;channel-definition id=\"my-http\" class=\"mx.messaging.channels.HTTPChannel\"&gt;\n &lt;endpoint url=\"http://{server.name}:{server.port}/{context.root}/messagebroker/http\" class=\"flex.messaging.endpoints.HTTPEndpoint\"/&gt;\n&lt;/channel-definition&gt;\n </code></pre>\n\n <p>Once the HTTPEndpoint is configured, make sure the service is exposed via the channel by adding the channel (e.g. my-http) to your remoting-services.xml file.\n For example this allows services to be accessed remotely by both AMF and AMFX:</p>\n <pre><code>\n&lt;default-channels&gt;\n &lt;channel ref=\"my-amf\"/&gt;\n &lt;channel ref=\"my-http\"/&gt;\n&lt;/default-channels&gt;\n </code></pre>\n\n <p>In order to make a call, you first need to declare the API to Ext direct. The following example defines local methods to the services provided by the sample Products application provided by Adobe as part of the BlazeDS 4.x binary turnkey distribution's testdrive (Sample 5: Updating Data):</p>\n <pre><code>\n    Ext.direct.Manager.addProvider({\n        \"url\":\"/samples/messagebroker/http\", // URL for the HTTPEndpoint\n        \"type\":\"amfremoting\",\n        \"endpoint\": \"my-http\", // the name of the HTTPEndpoint channel as defined in the server's services-config.xml\n        \"actions\":{\n        \"product\":[{ // name of the destination as defined in remoting-config.xml on the server\n            \"name\":\"getProducts\", // method name of the method to call\n            \"len\":0 // number of parameters\n        },{\n            \"name\":\"add\",\n            \"len\":1\n        },{\n            \"name\":\"bad\",\n            \"len\":0\n        }]\n        }\n    });\n\n </code></pre>\n <p>You can now call the service as follows:</p>\n <pre><code>\nproduct.getProducts((function(provider, response) {\n    // do something with the response\n    console.log(\"Got \" + response.data.length + \" objects\");\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n Note that in case server methods require parameters of a specific class (e.g. flex.samples.product.Product), you should make sure the passed parameter has a field called $flexType set to the class name (in this case flex.Samples.product.Product). This is similar to the remote class alias definition in ActionScript.\n\n\n <p>The following example shows how to define a binary AMF-based call:</p>\n <pre><code>\n    Ext.direct.Manager.addProvider({\n        \"url\":\"/samples/messagebroker/amf\", // URL for the AMFEndpoint\n        \"type\":\"amfremoting\",\n        \"endpoint\": \"my-amf\", // the name of the AMFEndpoint channel as defined in the server's services-config.xml\n        \"binary\": true, // chooses AMF encoding\n        \"actions\":{\n        \"product\":[{ // name of the destination as defined in remoting-config.xml on the server\n            \"name\":\"getProducts\", // method name of the method to call\n            \"len\":0 // number of parameters\n        },{\n            \"name\":\"add\",\n            \"len\":1\n        },{\n            \"name\":\"bad\",\n            \"len\":0\n        }]\n        }\n    });\n\n </code></pre>\n <p>Calling the server is done the same way as for the AMFX-based definition.</p>\n",

The Ext.data namespace also includes classes for working\nwith Ext.data.Stores which are backed by data from an Ext Direct method.\n\n# Specification\n\nFor additional information consult the [Ext Direct Specification][1].\n\n# Providers\n\nExt Direct uses a provider architecture, where one or more providers are used\nto transport data to and from the server. There are several providers that exist\nin the core at the moment:\n\n- {@link Ext.direct.JsonProvider} for simple JSON operations\n- {@link Ext.direct.PollingProvider} for repeated requests\n- {@link Ext.direct.RemotingProvider} exposes server side to the client.\n\nA provider does not need to be invoked directly, providers are added via\n{@link Ext.direct.Manager}. RemotingProviders' API declarations\ncan also be loaded with {@link Ext.direct.Manager}, with\nProvider instance created automatically after successful retrieval.\n\n# Router\n\nExt Direct RemotingProviders utilize a \"router\" on the server to direct\nrequests from the client to the appropriate server-side method. Because\nthe Ext Direct API is platform-agnostic, you could completely swap out\na Java based server solution and replace it with one that uses C#\nwithout changing the client side JavaScript at all, or vice versa.\n\n# Server side events\n\nCustom events from the server may be handled by the client by adding listeners, for example:\n\n    {\"type\":\"event\",\"name\":\"message\",\"data\":\"Successfully polled at: 11:19:30 am\"}\n\n    // add a handler for a 'message' event sent by the server\n    Ext.direct.Manager.on('message', function(e){\n        out.append(String.format('<p><i>{0}</i></p>', e.data));\n        out.el.scrollTo('t', 100000, true);\n    });\n\n   [1]: http://sencha.com/products/extjs/extdirect\n",

Many events are\nnot listed here due to the expedient rate of change across browsers. For a more comprehensive list, please visit the\nfollowing resources:\n\n+ [Mozilla Event Reference Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)\n+ [W3 Pointer Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/)\n+ [W3 Touch Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/)\n+ [W3 DOM 2 Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/)\n+ [W3 DOM 3 Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/)\n\n## Usage\n\n    // by id\n    var el = Ext.get(\"my-div\");\n\n    // by DOM element reference\n    var el = Ext.get(myDivElement);\n\n## Selecting Descendant Elements\n\nExt.dom.Element instances can be used to select descendant nodes using CSS selectors.\nThere are 3 methods that can be used for this purpose, each with a slightly different\ntwist:\n\n- {@link #method!query #method-query}\n- {@link #method!selectNode #method-selectNode}\n- {@link #method!select #method-select}\n\nThese methods can accept any valid CSS selector since they all use\n[querySelectorAll](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/) under the hood. The primary\ndifference between these three methods is their return type:\n\nTo get an array of HTMLElement instances matching the selector '.foo' use the query\nmethod:\n\n    element.query('.foo');\n\nThis can easily be transformed into an array of Ext.dom.Element instances by setting\nthe `asDom` parameter to `false`:\n\n    element.query('.foo', false);\n\nIf the desired result is only the first matching HTMLElement use the selectNode method:\n\n    element.selectNode('.foo');\n\nOnce again, the dom node can be wrapped in an Ext.dom.Element by setting the `asDom`\nparameter to `false`:\n\n    element.selectNode('.foo', false);\n\nThe `select` method is used when the desired return type is a {@link Ext.dom.CompositeElementLite CompositeElementLite} or a {@link Ext.dom.CompositeElement CompositeElement}.  These are collections of elements that can be operated on as a\ngroup using any of the methods of Ext.dom.Element.  The only difference between the two\nis that CompositeElementLite is a collection of HTMLElement instances, while\nCompositeElement is a collection of Ext.dom.Element instances.  To retrieve a\nCompositeElementLite that represents a collection of HTMLElements for selector '.foo':\n\n    element.select('.foo');\n\nFor a {@link Ext.dom.CompositeElement CompositeElement} simply pass `true` as the\n`composite` parameter:\n\n    element.select('.foo', true);\n\nThe query selection methods can be used even if you don't have a Ext.dom.Element to\nstart with For example to select an array of all HTMLElements in the document that match the\nselector '.foo', simply wrap the document object in an Ext.dom.Element instance using\n{@link Ext#method!fly Ext#fly}:\n\n    Ext.fly(document).query('.foo');\n\n# Animations\n\nWhen an element is manipulated, by default there is no animation.\n\n    var el = Ext.get(\"my-div\");\n\n    // no animation\n    el.setWidth(100);\n\nspecified as boolean (true) for default animation effects.\n\n    // default animation\n    el.setWidth(100, true);\n\nTo configure the effects, an object literal with animation options to use as the Element animation configuration\nobject can also be specified. Note that the supported Element animation configuration options are a subset of the\n{@link Ext.fx.Anim} animation options specific to Fx effects. The supported Element animation configuration options\nare:\n\n    Option    Default   Description\n    --------- --------  ---------------------------------------------\n    duration  350       The duration of the animation in milliseconds\n    easing    easeOut   The easing method\n    callback  none      A function to execute when the anim completes\n    scope     this      The scope (this) of the callback function\n\nUsage:\n\n    // Element animation options object\n    var opt = {\n        duration: 1000,\n        easing: 'elasticIn',\n        callback: this.foo,\n        scope: this\n    };\n    // animation with some options set\n    el.setWidth(100, opt);\n\nThe Element animation object being used for the animation will be set on the options object as \"anim\", which allows\nyou to stop or manipulate the animation. Here is an example:\n\n    // using the \"anim\" property to get the Anim object\n    if(opt.anim.isAnimated()){\n        opt.anim.stop();\n    }\n",

        "doc": "The DomHelper class provides a layer of abstraction from DOM and transparently supports creating elements via DOM or\nusing HTML fragments. It also has the ability to create HTML fragment templates from your DOM building code.\n\n## DomHelper element specification object\n\nA specification object is used when creating elements. Attributes of this object are assumed to be element\nattributes, except for 4 special attributes:\n\n* **tag**: The tag name of the element\n* **children (or cn)**: An array of the same kind of element definition objects to be created and appended. These\ncan be nested as deep as you want.\n* **cls**: The class attribute of the element. This will end up being either the \"class\" attribute on a HTML\nfragment or className for a DOM node, depending on whether DomHelper is using fragments or DOM.\n* **html**: The innerHTML for the element\n\n## Insertion methods\n\nCommonly used insertion methods:\n\n* {@link #method!append #append}\n* {@link #method!insertBefore #insertBefore}\n* {@link #method!insertAfter #insertAfter}\n* {@link #method!overwrite #overwrite}\n* {@link #method!insertHtml #insertHtml}\n\n## Example\n\nThis is an example, where an unordered list with 3 children items is appended to an existing element with id\n'my-div':\n\n    var dh = Ext.DomHelper; // create shorthand alias\n    // specification object\n    var spec = {\n        id: 'my-ul',\n        tag: 'ul',\n        cls: 'my-list',\n        // append children after creating\n        children: [     // may also specify 'cn' instead of 'children'\n            {tag: 'li', id: 'item0', html: 'List Item 0'},\n            {tag: 'li', id: 'item1', html: 'List Item 1'},\n            {tag: 'li', id: 'item2', html: 'List Item 2'}\n        ]\n    };\n    var list = dh.append(\n        'my-div', // the context element 'my-div' can either be the id or the actual node\n        spec      // the specification object\n    );\n\nElement creation specification parameters in this class may also be passed as an Array of specification objects.\nThis can be used to insert multiple sibling nodes into an existing container very efficiently. For example, to add\nmore list items to the example above:\n\n    dh.append('my-ul', [\n        {tag: 'li', id: 'item3', html: 'List Item 3'},\n        {tag: 'li', id: 'item4', html: 'List Item 4'}\n    ]);\n\n## Templating\n\nThe real power is in the built-in templating. Instead of creating or appending any elements, createTemplate returns\na Template object which can be used over and over to insert new elements. Revisiting the example above, we could\nutilize templating this time:\n\n    // create the node\n    var list = dh.append('my-div', {tag: 'ul', cls: 'my-list'});\n    // get template\n    var tpl = dh.createTemplate({tag: 'li', id: 'item{0}', html: 'List Item {0}'});\n\n    for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++){\n        tpl.append(list, i); // use template to append to the actual node\n    }\n\nAn example using a template:\n\n    var html = '\"{0}\" href=\"{1}\" class=\"nav\">{2}';\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.DomHelper.createTemplate(html);\n    tpl.append('blog-roll', ['link1', 'http://www.foxmulder.com/', \"Fox's Site\"]);\n    tpl.append('blog-roll', ['link2', 'http://www.danascully.org/', \"Scully's Site\"]);\n\nThe same example using named parameters:\n\n    var html = '\"{id}\" href=\"{url}\" class=\"nav\">{text}';\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.DomHelper.createTemplate(html);\n    tpl.append('blog-roll', {\n        id: 'link1',\n        url: 'http://www.danascully.org/',\n        text: \"Scully's Site\"\n    });\n    tpl.append('blog-roll', {\n        id: 'link2',\n        url: 'http://www.foxmulder.com/',\n        text: \"Fox's Site\"\n    });\n\n## Compiling Templates\n\nTemplates are applied using regular expressions. The performance is great, but if you are adding a bunch of DOM\nelements using the same template, you can increase performance even further by \"compiling\" the template. The way\n\"compile()\" works is the template is parsed and broken up at the different variable points and a dynamic function is\ncreated and eval'ed. The generated function performs string concatenation of these parts and the passed variables\ninstead of using regular expressions.\n\n    var html = '\"{id}\" href=\"{url}\" class=\"nav\">{text}';\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.DomHelper.createTemplate(html);\n    tpl.compile();\n\n    // ... use template like normal\n\n## Performance Boost\n\nDomHelper will transparently create HTML fragments when it can. Using HTML fragments instead of DOM can\nsignificantly boost performance.\n\nElement creation specification parameters may also be strings which are used as innerHTML.\n",

        "doc": "\nProvides high performance selector/xpath processing by compiling queries into reusable functions. New pseudo classes\nand matchers can be plugged. It works on HTML and XML documents (if a content node is passed in).\n\nDomQuery supports most of the [CSS3 selectors spec][1], along with some custom selectors and basic XPath.\n\nAll selectors, attribute filters and pseudos below can be combined infinitely in any order. For example\n`div.foo:nth-child(odd)[@foo=bar].bar:first` would be a perfectly valid selector. Node filters are processed\nin the order in which they appear, which allows you to optimize your queries for your document structure.\n\n## Simple Selectors\n\nFor performance reasons, some query methods accept selectors that are termed as **simple selectors**. A simple\nselector is a selector that does not include contextual information about any parent/sibling elements.\n\nSome examples of valid simple selectors:\n\n    var simple = '.foo'; // Only asking for the class name on the element\n    var simple = 'div.bar'; // Only asking for the tag/class name on the element\n    var simple = '[href];' // Asking for an attribute on the element.\n    var simple = ':not(.foo)'; // Only asking for the non-matches against the class name\n    var simple = 'span:first-child'; // Doesn't require any contextual information about the parent node\n\nSimple examples of invalid simple selectors:\n\n    var notSimple = 'div.foo div.bar'; // Requires matching a parent node by class name\n    var notSimple = 'span + div'; //  Requires matching a sibling by tag name\n\n## Element Selectors:\n\n  - **`*`** any element\n  - **`E`** an element with the tag E\n  - **`E F`** All descendent elements of E that have the tag F\n  - **`E > F`** or **E/F** all direct children elements of E that have the tag F\n  - **`E + F`** all elements with the tag F that are immediately preceded by an element with the tag E\n  - **`E ~ F`** all elements with the tag F that are preceded by a sibling element with the tag E\n\n## Attribute Selectors:\n\nThe use of `@` and quotes are optional. For example, `div[@foo='bar']` is also a valid attribute selector.\n\n  - **`E[foo]`** has an attribute \"foo\"\n  - **`E[foo=bar]`** has an attribute \"foo\" that equals \"bar\"\n  - **`E[foo^=bar]`** has an attribute \"foo\" that starts with \"bar\"\n  - **`E[foo$=bar]`** has an attribute \"foo\" that ends with \"bar\"\n  - **`E[foo*=bar]`** has an attribute \"foo\" that contains the substring \"bar\"\n  - **`E[foo%=2]`** has an attribute \"foo\" that is evenly divisible by 2\n  - **`E[foo!=bar]`** attribute \"foo\" does not equal \"bar\"\n\n## Pseudo Classes:\n\n  - **`E:first-child`** E is the first child of its parent\n  - **`E:last-child`** E is the last child of its parent\n  - **`E:nth-child(_n_)`** E is the _n_th child of its parent (1 based as per the spec)\n  - **`E:nth-child(odd)`** E is an odd child of its parent\n  - **`E:nth-child(even)`** E is an even child of its parent\n  - **`E:only-child`** E is the only child of its parent\n  - **`E:checked`** E is an element that is has a checked attribute that is true (e.g. a radio or checkbox)\n  - **`E:first`** the first E in the resultset\n  - **`E:last`** the last E in the resultset\n  - **`E:nth(_n_)`** the _n_th E in the resultset (1 based)\n  - **`E:odd`** shortcut for :nth-child(odd)\n  - **`E:even`** shortcut for :nth-child(even)\n  - **`E:contains(foo)`** E's innerHTML contains the substring \"foo\"\n  - **`E:nodeValue(foo)`** E contains a textNode with a nodeValue that equals \"foo\"\n  - **`E:not(S)`** an E element that does not match simple selector S\n  - **`E:has(S)`** an E element that has a descendent that matches simple selector S\n  - **`E:next(S)`** an E element whose next sibling matches simple selector S\n  - **`E:prev(S)`** an E element whose previous sibling matches simple selector S\n  - **`E:any(S1|S2|S2)`** an E element which matches any of the simple selectors S1, S2 or S3\n  - **`E:visible(true)`** an E element which is deeply visible according to {@link Ext.dom.Element#method!isVisible Ext.dom.Element#isVisible}\n\n## CSS Value Selectors:\n\n  - **`E{display=none}`** css value \"display\" that equals \"none\"\n  - **`E{display^=none}`** css value \"display\" that starts with \"none\"\n  - **`E{display$=none}`** css value \"display\" that ends with \"none\"\n  - **`E{display*=none}`** css value \"display\" that contains the substring \"none\"\n  - **`E{display%=2}`** css value \"display\" that is evenly divisible by 2\n  - **`E{display!=none}`** css value \"display\" that does not equal \"none\"\n\n## XML Namespaces:\n  - **`ns|E`** an element with tag E and namespace prefix ns\n\n[1]: http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-css3-selectors-20051215/#selectors\n",

This method\nis called once at the beginning of the drag. It should populate the info object with data using\nthe {@link Ext.data.Info#setData setData} method. It accepts 2 arguments.\n\n- The `type` is used to indicate to {@link Ext.drag.Target} the type(s) of data being provided.\nThis allows the {@link Ext.drag.Target} to decide whether it is able to interact with the source.\nAll types added are available in {@link Ext.data.Info#types types}.\n- The value can be a static value, or a function reference. In the latter case, the function is evaluated\nwhen the data is requested.\n\nThe {@link Ext.drag.Info#method!getData Ext.drag.Info#getData} method may be called once the drop completes. The data for the relevant type\nis retrieved. All values from this method return a {@link Ext.Promise} to allow for consistency when dealing\nwith synchronous and asynchronous data.\n\n## Proxy\n\nA {@link #cfg!proxy #proxy} is an element that follows the mouse cursor during a drag.

If the method returns `false`, the drag is not considered valid.\n\n## Asynchronous drop processing\n\n When the drop completes, the {@link #event!drop #drop} event will fire, however the underlying data\nmay not be ready to be consumed.

        "doc": "Ext.draw.Matix is a utility class used to calculate\n[affine transformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation) matrix.\nThe matrix class is used to apply transformations to existing\n{@link Ext.draw.sprite.Sprite} using a number of convenience transform\nmethods.\n\nTransformations configured directly on a sprite are processed in the following order:\nscaling, rotation, and translation.  The matrix class offers additional flexibility.\nOnce a sprite is created, you can use the matrix class's transform methods as many\ntimes as needed and in any order you choose.\n\nTo demonstrate, we'll start with a simple {@link Ext.draw.sprite.Rect} sprite\nwith the intent of rotating it 180 degrees with the bottom right corner being the\ncenter of rotation.  To begin, let's look at the initial, untransformed sprite:\n\n    @example\n    var drawContainer = new Ext.draw.Container({\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        width: 380,\n        height: 380,\n        sprites: [{\n            type: 'rect',\n            width: 100,\n            height: 100,\n            fillStyle: 'red'\n        }]\n    });\n\nNext, we'll use the {@link #method!rotate #rotate} and {@link #method!translate #translate} methods from our matrix\nclass to position the rect sprite.\n\n    @example\n    var drawContainer = new Ext.draw.Container({\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        width: 380,\n        height: 380,\n        sprites: [{\n            type: 'rect',\n            width: 100,\n            height: 100,\n            fillStyle: 'red'\n        }]\n    });\n\n    var main = drawContainer.getSurface();\n    var rect = main.getItems()[0];\n\n    var m = new Ext.draw.Matrix().translate(100, 100).\n    rotate(Math.PI).\n    translate(-100, - 100);\n\n    rect.setTransform(m);\n    main.renderFrame();\n\nIn the previous example we perform the following steps in order to achieve our\ndesired rotated output:\n\n - translate the rect to the right and down by 100\n - rotate by 180 degrees\n - translate the rect to the right and down by 100\n\n**Note:** A couple of things to note at this stage; 1) the rotation center point is\nthe upper left corner of the sprite by default and 2) with transformations, the\nsprite itself isn't transformed, but rather the entire coordinate plane of the sprite\nis transformed.  The coordinate plane itself is translated by 100 and then rotated\n180 degrees.  And that is why in the third step we translate the sprite using\nnegative values.  Translating by -100 in the third step results in the sprite\nvisually moving to the right and down within the draw container.\n\nFortunately there is a shortcut we can apply using two optional params of the rotate\nmethod allowing us to specify the center point of rotation:\n\n    @example\n    var drawContainer = new Ext.draw.Container({\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        width: 380,\n        height: 380,\n        sprites: [{\n            type: 'rect',\n            width: 100,\n            height: 100,\n            fillStyle: 'red'\n        }]\n    });\n\n    var main = drawContainer.getSurface();\n    var rect = main.getItems()[0];\n\n    var m = new Ext.draw.Matrix().rotate(Math.PI, 100, 100);\n\n    rect.setTransform(m);\n    main.renderFrame();\n\n\nThis class is compatible with\n[SVGMatrix](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#InterfaceSVGMatrix) except:\n\n  1. Ext.draw.Matrix is not read only\n  2. Using Number as its values rather than floats\n\nUsing this class helps to reduce the severe numeric\n[problem with HTML Canvas and SVG transformation](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8784405/large-numbers-in-html-canvas-translate-result-in-strange-behavior)\n\nAdditionally, there's no way to get the current transformation matrix\n[in Canvas](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7395813/html5-canvas-get-transform-matrix).\n",

        "doc": "A sprite is a basic primitive from the charts package which represents a graphical\nobject that can be drawn. Sprites are used extensively in the charts package to\ncreate the visual elements of each chart.  You can also create a desired image by\nadding one or more sprites to a {@link Ext.draw.Container}.\n\nThe Sprite class itself is an abstract class and is not meant to be used directly.\nThere are many different kinds of sprites available in the charts package that extend\nExt.draw.sprite.Sprite. Each sprite type has various attributes that define how that\nsprite should look. For example, this is a {@link Ext.draw.sprite.Rect} sprite:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'draw',\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        width: 400,\n        height: 400,\n        sprites: [{\n            type: 'rect',\n            x: 50,\n            y: 50,\n            width: 100,\n            height: 100,\n            fillStyle: '#1F6D91'\n        }]\n    });\n\nBy default, sprites are added to the default 'main' {@link Ext.draw.Surface}\nof the draw container.  However, sprites may also be configured with a reference to a\nspecific Ext.draw.Surface when set in the draw container's\n{@link Ext.draw.Container#cfg!sprites sprites} config.  Specifying a surface\nother than 'main' will create a surface by that name if it does not already exist.\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'draw',\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        width: 400,\n        height: 400,\n        sprites: [{\n            type: 'rect',\n            surface: 'anim',  // a surface with id \"anim\" will be created automatically\n            x: 50,\n            y: 50,\n            width: 100,\n            height: 100,\n            fillStyle: '#1F6D91'\n        }]\n    });\n\nThe ability to have multiple surfaces is useful for performance (and battery life)\nreasons. Because changes to sprite attributes cause the whole surface (and all\nsprites in it) to re-render, it makes sense to group sprites by surface, so changes\nto one group of sprites will only trigger the surface they are in to re-render.\n\nYou can add a sprite to an existing drawing by adding the sprite to a draw surface.\n\n    @example\n    var drawCt = Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'draw',\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        width: 400,\n        height: 400\n    });\n\n    // If the surface name is not specified then 'main' will be used\n    var surface = drawCt.getSurface();\n\n    surface.add({\n        type: 'rect',\n        x: 50,\n        y: 50,\n        width: 100,\n        height: 100,\n        fillStyle: '#1F6D91'\n    });\n\n    surface.renderFrame();\n\n**Note:** Changes to the sprites on a surface will be not be reflected in the DOM\nuntil you call the surface's {@link Ext.draw.Surface#method!renderFrame renderFrame}\nmethod.  This must be done after adding, removing, or modifying sprites in order to\nsee the changes on-screen.\n\nFor information on configuring a sprite with an initial transformation see\n{@link #cfg!scaling #scaling}, {@link rotation}, and {@link translation}.\n\nFor information on applying a transformation to an existing sprite see the\nExt.draw.Matrix class.\n",

The surface API has methods to render\nsprites, get sprite bounding boxes (dimensions), add sprites to the underlying DOM,\nand more.\n\nA surface is automatically created when a draw container is created.  By default,\nthis will be a surface with an `{@link #cfg!id id}` of \"main\" and will manage all sprites in the draw\ncontainer (unless the sprite configs specify a unique surface \"id\").\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'draw',\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        width: 400,\n        height: 400,\n        sprites: [{\n            type: 'rect',\n            surface: 'anim',  // a surface with id \"anim\" will be created automatically\n            x: 50,\n            y: 50,\n            width: 100,\n            height: 100,\n            fillStyle: '#1F6D91'\n        }]\n    });\n\nThe ability to have multiple surfaces is useful for performance (and battery life)\nreasons. Because changes to sprite attributes cause the whole surface (and all\nsprites in it) to re-render, it makes sense to group sprites by surface, so changes\nto one group of sprites will only trigger the surface they are in to re-render.\n\nOne of the more useful methods is the {@link #method!add #add} method used to add sprites to the\nsurface:\n\n    @example\n    var drawCt = Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'draw',\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        width: 400,\n        height: 400\n    });\n\n    // If the surface name is not specified then 'main' will be used\n    var surface = drawCt.getSurface();\n\n    surface.add({\n        type: 'rect',\n        x: 50,\n        y: 50,\n        width: 100,\n        height: 100,\n        fillStyle: '#1F6D91'\n    });\n\n    surface.renderFrame();\n\n**Note:** Changes to the sprites on a surface will be not be reflected in the DOM\nuntil you call the surface's {@link Ext.draw.Surface#method!renderFrame renderFrame}\nmethod.  This must be done after adding, removing, or modifying sprites in order to\nsee the changes on-screen.\n",

Instead use `Ext.onReady`:\n\n     Ext.onReady(function () {\n         // DOM and Framework are ready...\n     });\n\n## DOM Ready\n\nThe lowest-level of readiness is DOM readiness. This level implies only that the document\nbody exists. Many things require the DOM to be ready for manipulation. If that is all\nthat is required, the `Ext.onDocumentReady` method can be called to register a callback\nto be called as soon as the DOM is ready:\n\n     Ext.onDocumentReady(function () {\n         // the document body is ready\n     });\n\n## Framework Ready\n\nIn production builds of applications it is common to have all of the code loaded before\nDOM ready, so the need to wait for \"onReady\" is often confused with only that concern.\nThis is easy to understand, at least in part because historically `Ext.onReady` only\nwaited for DOM ready.\n\nWith the introduction of `{@link Ext.Loader}`, however, it became common for DOM ready to occur\nin the middle of dynamically loading code. If application code were executed at that\ntime, any use of the yet-to-be-loaded classes would throw errors. As a consequence of\nthis, the `Ext.onReady` mechanism was extended to wait for both DOM ready *and* all of\nthe required classes to be loaded.\n\nWhen the framework enters or leaves a state where it is not ready (for example, the\nfirst dynamic load is requested or last load completes), `{@link Ext.env.Ready}` is informed.\nFor example:\n\n     Ext.env.Ready.block();\n\n     //...\n\n     Ext.env.Ready.unblock();\n\nWhen there are no blocks and the DOM is ready, the Framework is ready and the \"onReady\"\ncallbacks are called.\n\nPriority can be used to control the ordering of onReady listeners, for example:\n\n    Ext.onReady(function() {\n\n    }, null, {\n        priority: 100\n    });\n\nReady listeners with higher priorities will run sooner than those with lower priorities,\nthe default priority being `0`.  Internally the framework reserves priorities of 1000\nor greater, and -1000 or lesser for onReady handlers that must run before or after\nany application code.  Applications should stick to using priorities in the -999 - 999\nrange. The following priorities are currently in use by the framework:\n\n- Element_scroll rtl override: `1001`\n- Event system initialization: `2000`\n- Ext.dom.Element: `1500`\n",

        "doc": "A helper class for the native JavaScript Error object that adds a few useful capabilities for handling\nerrors in an application. When you use Ext.Error to {@link #static-method!raise #raise} an error from within any class that\nuses the Class System, the Error class can automatically add the source class and method from which\nthe error was raised. It also includes logic to automatically log the error to the console, if available,\nwith additional metadata about the error. In all cases, the error will always be thrown at the end so that\nexecution will halt.\n\nExt.Error also offers a global error {@link #static-method!handle handling} method that can be overridden in order to\nhandle application-wide errors in a single spot. You can optionally {@link #static-property!ignore #ignore} errors altogether,\nalthough in a real application it's usually a better idea to override the handling function and perform\nlogging or some other method of reporting the errors in a way that is meaningful to the application.\n\nAt its simplest you can simply raise an error as a simple string from within any code:\n\nExample usage:\n\n    Ext.raise('Something bad happened!');\n\nIf raised from plain JavaScript code, the error will be logged to the console (if available) and the message\ndisplayed. In most cases however you'll be raising errors from within a class, and it may often be useful to add\nadditional metadata about the error being raised.  The {@link #static-method!raise #raise} method can also take a config object.\nIn this form the `msg` attribute becomes the error description, and any other data added to the config gets\nadded to the error object and, if the console is available, logged to the console for inspection.\n\nExample usage:\n\n    Ext.define('Ext.Foo', {\n        doSomething: function(option){\n            if (someCondition === false) {\n                Ext.raise({\n                    msg: 'You cannot do that!',\n                    option: option,   // whatever was passed into the method\n                    'error code': 100 // other arbitrary info\n                });\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nIf a console is available (that supports the `console.dir` function) you'll see console output like:\n\n    An error was raised with the following data:\n    option:         Object { foo: \"bar\"}\n        foo:        \"bar\"\n    error code:     100\n    msg:            \"You cannot do that!\"\n    sourceClass:   \"Ext.Foo\"\n    sourceMethod:  \"doSomething\"\n\n    uncaught exception: You cannot do that!\n\nAs you can see, the error will report exactly where it was raised and will include as much information as the\nraising code can usefully provide.\n\nIf you want to handle all application errors globally you can simply override the static {@link #static-method!handle #handle} method\nand provide whatever handling logic you need. If the method returns true then the error is considered handled\nand will not be thrown to the browser. If anything but true is returned then the error will be thrown normally.\n\nExample usage:\n\n    Ext.Error.handle = function(err) {\n        if (err.someProperty == 'NotReallyAnError') {\n            // maybe log something to the application here if applicable\n            return true;\n        }\n        // any non-true return value (including none) will cause the error to be thrown\n    }\n",

This could be achieved using the available exporters independently.\n\n     var exporter = Ext.Factory.exporter({\n         type: 'excel',\n         data: {\n             columns: [{\n                 text: 'Vacation',\n                 columns: [\n                     { text: 'Month', width: 200, style: { alignment: { horizontal: 'Right' } } },\n                     { text: 'Days', style: { format: 'General Number' } }\n                 ]\n             }],\n             groups: [{\n                 text: 'Employees',\n                 groups: [{\n                     text: 'Adrian',\n                     rows: [{\n                         cells: [\n                             { value: 'January' },\n                             { value: 2 }\n                         ]\n                     },{\n                         cells: [\n                             { value: 'July' },\n                             { value: 10 }\n                         ]\n                     }],\n                     summaries: [{\n                         cells: [\n                             { value: 'Total' },\n                             { value: 12 }\n                         ]\n                     }]\n                 },{\n                     text: 'John',\n                     rows: [{\n                         cells: [\n                             { value: 'March' },\n                             { value: 4 }\n                         ]\n                     },{\n                         cells: [\n                             { value: 'May' },\n                             { value: 4 }\n                         ]\n                     },{\n                         cells: [\n                             { value: 'July' },\n                             { value: 2 }\n                         ]\n                     }],\n                     summaries: [{\n                         cells: [\n                             { value: 'Total' },\n                             { value: 10 }\n                         ]\n                     }]\n                 }],\n                 summaries: [{\n                     cells: [\n                         { value: 'Grand total' },\n                         { value: 22 }\n                     ]\n                 }]\n             }]\n         }\n     });\n\n     // save the file\n     exporter.saveAs().then( function() { exporter.destroy(); } );\n",

This is often useful for sending dynamic or previously collected data back to the\nserver in the same request as the normal form submission. For example, here is how we might set up a form to send\nback a hidden userId field:\n\n    @example\n    var form = Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        items: [\n            {\n                xtype: 'fieldset',\n                title: 'Enter your name',\n                items: [\n                    {\n                        xtype: 'hiddenfield',\n                        name: 'userId',\n                        value: 123\n                    },\n                    {\n                        xtype: 'checkboxfield',\n                        label: 'Enable notifications',\n                        name: 'notifications'\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n\nIn the form above we created two fields - a hidden field and a {@link Ext.field.Checkbox}. Only the\ncheck box will be visible, but both fields will be submitted. Hidden fields cannot be tabbed to - they are removed\nfrom the tab index so when your user taps the next/previous field buttons the hidden field is skipped over.\n\nIt's easy to read and update the value of a hidden field within a form. Using the example above, we can get a\nreference to the hidden field and then set it to a new value in 2 lines of code:\n\n    var userId = form.down('hiddenfield')[0];\n    userId.setValue(1234);\n",

Here's how we might use one in a form:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        items: [\n            {\n                xtype: 'fieldset',\n                title: 'How old are you?',\n                items: [\n                    {\n                        xtype: 'numberfield',\n                        label: 'Age',\n                        minValue: 18,\n                        maxValue: 150,\n                        name: 'age'\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n\nOr on its own, outside of a form:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.field.Number', {\n        label: 'Age',\n        value: '26'\n    });\n\n## minValue, maxValue and stepValue\n\nThe {@link #cfg!minValue #minValue} and {@link #cfg!maxValue #maxValue} configurations are self-explanatory and simply constrain the value\nentered to the range specified by the configured min and max values. The other option exposed by this component\nis {@link #cfg!stepValue #stepValue}, which enables you to set how much the value changes every time the up and down spinners\nare tapped on. For example, to create a salary field that ticks up and down by $1,000 each tap we can do this:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        items: [\n            {\n                xtype: 'fieldset',\n                title: 'Are you rich yet?',\n                items: [\n                    {\n                        xtype: 'numberfield',\n                        label: 'Salary',\n                        value: 30000,\n                        minValue: 25000,\n                        maxValue: 50000,\n                        stepValue: 1000\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n\nThis creates a field that starts with a value of $30,000, steps up and down in $1,000 increments and will not go\nbeneath $25,000 or above $50,000.\n\nBecause number field inherits from {@link Ext.field.Text} it gains all of the functionality that text\nfields provide, including getting and setting the value at runtime, validations and various events that are fired as\nthe user interacts with the component. Check out the {@link Ext.field.Text} docs to see the additional functionality\navailable.\n",

Each slider contains a single 'thumb' that can be dragged along the slider's length to change the value.\nSliders are equally useful inside {@link Ext.form.Panel} and standalone. Here's how to quickly create a\nslider in form, in this case enabling a user to choose a percentage:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        items: [\n            {\n                xtype: 'sliderfield',\n                label: 'Percentage',\n                value: 50,\n                minValue: 0,\n                maxValue: 100\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n\nIn this case we set a starting value of 50%, and defined the min and max values to be 0 and 100 respectively, giving\nus a percentage slider. Because this is such a common use case, the defaults for {@link #cfg!minValue #minValue} and\n{@link #cfg!maxValue #maxValue} are already set to 0 and 100 so in the example above they could be removed.\n\nIt's often useful to render sliders outside the context of a form panel too. In this example we create a slider that\nallows a user to choose the waist measurement of a pair of jeans. Let's say the online store we're making this for\nsells jeans with waist sizes from 24 inches to 60 inches in 2 inch increments - here's how we might achieve that:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        items: [\n            {\n                xtype: 'sliderfield',\n                label: 'Waist Measurement',\n                minValue: 24,\n                maxValue: 60,\n                increment: 2,\n                value: 32\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n\nNow that we've got our slider, we can ask it what value it currently has and listen to events that it fires. For\nexample, if we wanted our app to show different images for different sizes, we can listen to the {@link #event!change #change}\nevent to be informed whenever the slider is moved:\n\n    slider.on('change', function(field, newValue) {\n        if (newValue[0] > 40) {\n            imgComponent.setSrc('large.png');\n        } else {\n            imgComponent.setSrc('small.png');\n        }\n    }, this);\n\nHere we listened to the {@link #event!change #change} event on the slider and updated the background image of an\n{@link Ext.Img} based on what size the user selected. Of course, you can use any logic inside your\nevent listener.\n",

It provides a baseline of shared\nfunctionality such as input validation, standard events, state management and look and feel. Typically we create\ntext fields inside a form, like this:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        items: [\n            {\n                xtype: 'fieldset',\n                title: 'Enter your name',\n                items: [\n                    {\n                        xtype: 'textfield',\n                        label: 'First Name',\n                        name: 'firstName'\n                    },\n                    {\n                        xtype: 'textfield',\n                        label: 'Last Name',\n                        name: 'lastName'\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n\nThis creates two text fields inside a form. Text Fields can also be created outside of a Form, like this:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.field.Text', {\n        label: 'Your Name',\n        value: 'Ed Spencer'\n    });\n\n## Configuring\n\nText field offers several configuration options, including {@link #cfg!placeHolder #placeHolder}, {@link #cfg!maxLength #maxLength},\n{@link #cfg!autoComplete #autoComplete}, {@link #cfg!autoCapitalize #autoCapitalize} and {@link #cfg!autoCorrect #autoCorrect}. For example, here is how we would configure\na text field to have a maximum length of 10 characters, with placeholder text that disappears when the field is\nfocused:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.field.Text', {\n        label: 'Username',\n        maxLength: 10,\n        placeHolder: 'Enter your username'\n    });\n\nThe autoComplete, autoCapitalize and autoCorrect configs simply set those attributes on the text field and allow the\nnative browser to provide those capabilities. For example, to enable auto complete and auto correct, simply\nconfigure your text field like this:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.field.Text', {\n        label: 'Username',\n        autoComplete: true,\n        autoCorrect: true\n    });\n\nThese configurations will be picked up by the native browser, which will enable the options at the OS level.\n\nText field inherits from {@link Ext.field.Field}, which is the base class for all fields and provides\na lot of shared functionality for all fields, including setting values, clearing and basic validation. See the\n{@link Ext.field.Field} documentation to see how to leverage its capabilities.\n",

Typically, text entry on mobile devices is not a pleasant experience for the user so\nit's good to limit your use of text areas to only those occasions when free form text is required or alternative\ninput methods like select boxes or radio buttons are not possible. Text Areas are usually created inside forms, like\nthis:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        items: [\n            {\n                xtype: 'fieldset',\n                title: 'About you',\n                items: [\n                    {\n                        xtype: 'textfield',\n                        label: 'Name',\n                        name: 'name'\n                    },\n                    {\n                        xtype: 'textareafield',\n                        label: 'Bio',\n                        maxRows: 4,\n                        name: 'bio'\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n\nIn the example above we're creating a form with a {@link Ext.field.Text} for the user's name and a text\narea for their bio. We used the {@link #cfg!maxRows #maxRows} configuration on the text area to tell it to grow to a maximum of 4\nrows of text before it starts using a scroll bar inside the text area to scroll the text.\n\nWe can also create a text area outside the context of a form, like this:\n\nThis creates two text fields inside a form. Text Fields can also be created outside of a Form, like this:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.field.TextArea', {\n        label: 'About You',\n        placeHolder: 'Tell us about yourself...'\n    });\n",

        "type": "Ext.form.Panel",
        "doc": "The Form panel presents a set of form fields and provides convenient ways to load and save data. Usually a form\npanel just contains the set of fields you want to display, ordered inside the items configuration like this:\n\n    @example\n    var form = Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        items: [\n            {\n                xtype: 'textfield',\n                name: 'name',\n                label: 'Name'\n            },\n            {\n                xtype: 'emailfield',\n                name: 'email',\n                label: 'Email'\n            },\n            {\n                xtype: 'passwordfield',\n                name: 'password',\n                label: 'Password'\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n\nHere we just created a simple form panel which could be used as a registration form to sign up to your service. We\nadded a plain {@link Ext.field.Text} for the user's Name, an {@link Ext.field.Email} and\nfinally a {@link Ext.field.Password}. In each case we provided a {@link Ext.field.Field#cfg!name name}\nconfig on the field so that we can identify it later on when we load and save data on the form.\n\n##Loading data\n\nUsing the form we created above, we can load data into it in a few different ways, the easiest is to use\n{@link #method!setValues #setValues}:\n\n    form.setValues({\n        name: 'Peter',\n        email: 'peter.venkman@gb.com',\n        password: 'secret'\n    });\n\nIt's also easy to load {@link Ext.data.Model} instances into a form - let's say we have a User model and want\nto load a particular instance into our form:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.model.User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        config: {\n            fields: ['name', 'email', 'password']\n        }\n    });\n\n    var ed = Ext.create('MyApp.model.User', {\n        name: 'Peter',\n        email: 'peter.venkman@gb.com',\n        password: 'secret'\n    });\n\n    form.setRecord(ed);\n\n##Retrieving form data\n\nGetting data out of the form panel is simple and is usually achieve via the {@link #method!getValues #getValues} method:\n\n    var values = form.getValues();\n\n    //values now looks like this:\n    {\n        name: 'Peter',\n        email: 'peter.venkman@gb.com',\n        password: 'secret'\n    }\n\nIt's also possible to listen to the change events on individual fields to get more timely notification of changes\nthat the user is making. Here we expand on the example above with the User model, updating the model as soon as\nany of the fields are changed:\n\n    var form = Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        listeners: {\n            '> field': {\n                change: function(field, newValue, oldValue) {\n                    ed.set(field.getName(), newValue);\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        items: [\n            {\n                xtype: 'textfield',\n                name: 'name',\n                label: 'Name'\n            },\n            {\n                xtype: 'emailfield',\n                name: 'email',\n                label: 'Email'\n            },\n            {\n                xtype: 'passwordfield',\n                name: 'password',\n                label: 'Password'\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n\nThe above attached a listener to the {@link Ext.field.Text#event!change change} event of each form\nfield that is a direct child of the form panel. Our listener gets the name of the field that fired the change event,\nand updates our {@link Ext.data.Model} instance with the new value. For example, changing the email field\nin the form will update the Model's email field.\n\n##Submitting forms\n\nThere are a few ways to submit form data. In our example above we have a Model instance that we have updated, giving\nus the option to use the Model's {@link Ext.data.Model#method!save save} method to persist the changes back to our server,\nwithout using a traditional form submission. Alternatively, we can send a normal browser form submit using the\n{@link #cfg!method #method} method:\n\n    form.submit({\n        url: 'url/to/submit/to',\n        method: 'POST',\n        success: function() {\n            alert('form submitted successfully!');\n        }\n    });\n\nIn this case we provided the `{@link #cfg!url url}` to submit the form to inside the submit call - alternatively you can just set the\n{@link #cfg!url #url} configuration when you create the form. We can specify other parameters (see {@link #cfg!method #method} for a\nfull list), including callback functions for success and failure, which are called depending on whether or not the\nform submission was successful. These functions are usually used to take some action in your app after your data\nhas been saved to the server side.\n",

In most apps we would be placing the grid inside another container\nand wouldn't need to provide the {@link #cfg!height #height}, {@link #cfg!width #width} and\n{@link #cfg!fullscreen #cfg-fullscreen} options but they are included here to for demonstration.\n\nThe grid we created above will contain a header bar with a title ('Simpsons'), a row of\ncolumn headers directly underneath and finally the grid rows under the headers.\n\n## Columns\n\nBy default, each {@link Ext.grid.column.Column} is sortable and toggles between\nascending and descending sorting when you click on its header. There are several basic\nconfigs that can be applied to columns to change these behaviors. For example:\n\n    columns: [\n        {\n            text: 'Name',\n            dataIndex: 'name',\n            sortable: false,  // column cannot be sorted\n            width: 250\n        },\n        {\n            text: 'Email',\n            dataIndex: 'email',\n            hidden: true  // column is initially hidden\n        },\n        {\n            text: 'Phone',\n            dataIndex: 'phone',\n            width: 100\n        }\n    ]\n\nWe turned off sorting on the 'Name' column so clicking its header now has no effect. We\nalso made the Email column hidden by default (it can be shown again by using the\n{@link Ext.grid.plugin.ViewOptions} plugin). See the\n{@link Ext.grid.column.Column} for more details.\n\nA top-level column definition may contain a `{@link #cfg!columns columns}` configuration. This means that the\nresulting header will be a group header, and will contain the child columns.\n\n## Rows and Cells\n\nGrid extends the `{@link Ext.dataview.List}` component and connects records in the\nstore to `{@link Ext.grid.Row}` for the list's items. The Row component\nutilizes the configs of the grid's {@link Ext.grid.column.Column} to create the\nappropriate type of {@link Ext.grid.cell.Base}. Essentially, a Row is a container\nfor {@link Ext.Widget}.\n\nFor the most part, configuring a grid is about configuring the columns and their cells.\nThere are several built-in column types to display specific types of data:\n\n - {@link Ext.grid.column.Boolean} for true/false values.\n - {@link Ext.grid.column.Date} for date/time values.\n - {@link Ext.grid.column.Number} for numeric values.\n\nThese columns specify (via their {@link Ext.grid.column.Column#cfg!cell cell config}) one\nof these basic cell widget types:\n\n - {@link Ext.grid.cell.Boolean}\n - {@link Ext.grid.cell.Date}\n - {@link Ext.grid.cell.Number}\n\nIn addition to the above basic cell types, there are two other useful cell types to\nknow about:\n\n - {@link Ext.grid.cell.Text} is the base class for the boolean, date and number cell\n   classes. It is useful when a cell contains only text.\n - {@link Ext.grid.cell.Widget} is a cell class that manages a single child item (either\n   a {@link Ext.Component} or a {@link Ext.Widget}). The child item is\n   configured using the `{@link Ext.grid.cell.Widget#cfg!widget widget config}`. The most\n   important part of this config is the `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}` of the child item to create.\n\n## Cells and Binding\n\nOne technique to controll cell content and styling is to use data binding to target\ncell configs like {@link Ext.grid.cell.Base#cfg!cls Ext.grid.cell.Base#cls} and {@link Ext.grid.cell.Base#cfg!innerCls Ext.grid.cell.Base#innerCls}.\nThis is done by assigning a {@link Ext.app.ViewModel} to each Row like so:\n\n     itemConfig: {\n         viewModel: true  // create default ViewModel for each item (i.e., Row)\n     }\n\nNow that each Row has a ViewModel, cells can bind to the fields of the associated record\nlike so:\n\n     columns: [{\n         ...\n         cell: {\n             bind: {\n                 cls: '{record.someCls}'\n             }\n         }\n     }]\n\nThe \"record\" property in the ViewModel is managed by the Row. As Row instances are\nrecycled due to buffered rendering, the associated record instance simply changes over\ntime.\n\n### Cell Widgets\n\nWhen using {@link Ext.grid.cell.Widget}, the contained widgets can also use binding to\nconfigure themsleves using properties of the associated record.\n\n     columns: [{\n         ...\n         cell: {\n             xtype: 'widgetcell',\n             widget: {\n                 xtype: 'button',\n                 bind: {\n                     text: 'Update {record.firstName}'\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n     }]\n\n### Row ViewModels\n\nIn some cases a custom ViewModel could be useful, for example to provide useful values\nvia {@link Ext.app.ViewModel#cfg!formulas formulas}.\n\n     itemConfig: {\n         viewModel: {\n             type: 'rowViewModel'\n         }\n     }\n\n## Renderers and Templates\n\nColumns provide two other mechanisms to format their cell content:\n\n - {@link Ext.grid.column.Column#cfg!renderer Ext.grid.column.Column#renderer}\n - {@link Ext.grid.column.Column#cfg!tpl Ext.grid.column.Column#tpl}\n\nThese column configs are processed by the {@link Ext.grid.column.Cell default cell type}\nfor a column. These configs have some downsides compared to data binding but are provided\nfor compatibility with previous releases.\n\n - Renderers and templates must update the cell content when _any_ field changes. They\n   cannot assume that only changes to the dataIndex will affect the rendering. Using\n   data binding, only the configs affected by the changed data will be updated.\n - Updates are processed synchronously in response to the record update notification.\n   Contrast to ViewModels which provide a buffered update mechanism.\n - Constructing HTML blocks in code (even in a template) is a common cause of security\n   problems such as XSS attacks.\n\n## Sorting & Filtering\n\nEvery grid is attached to a {@link Ext.data.Store}, which provides multi-sort and\nfiltering capabilities. It's easy to set up a grid to be sorted from the start:\n\n    var myGrid = Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {\n        store: {\n            fields: ['name', 'email', 'phone'],\n            sorters: ['name', 'phone']\n        },\n        columns: [\n            { text: 'Name',  dataIndex: 'name' },\n            { text: 'Email', dataIndex: 'email' }\n        ]\n    });\n\nSorting at run time is easily accomplished by simply clicking each column header. If you\nneed to perform sorting on more than one field at run time it's easy to do so by adding\nnew sorters to the store:\n\n    myGrid.store.sort([\n        { property: 'name',  direction: 'ASC' },\n        { property: 'email', direction: 'DESC' }\n    ]);\n\nSee {@link Ext.data.Store} for examples of filtering.\n\n## Plugins\n\nGrid supports addition of extra functionality through plugins:\n\n- {@link Ext.grid.plugin.ViewOptions} - adds the ability to show/hide\n columns and reorder them.\n\n- {@link Ext.grid.plugin.ColumnResizing} - allows for the ability to\n resize columns.\n\n- {@link Ext.grid.plugin.Editable} - editing grid contents one row at a time.\n\n- {@link Ext.grid.plugin.MultiSelection} - selecting and deleting several\n  rows at a time.\n\n- {@link Ext.grid.plugin.PagingToolbar} - adds a toolbar at the bottom of\n  the grid that allows you to quickly navigate to another page of data.\n\n- {@link Ext.grid.plugin.SummaryRow} - adds and pins an additional row to the\n  top of the grid that enables you to display summary data.\n",

You can see the changeable bits below:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'grid',\n        fullscreen: true,\n        plugins: {\n            type: 'grideditable',\n            triggerEvent: 'doubletap',\n            enableDeleteButton: true,\n            formConfig: null, // See more below\n\n            defaultFormConfig: {\n                xtype: 'formpanel',\n                scrollable: true,\n                items: {\n                    xtype: 'fieldset'\n                }\n            },\n\n            toolbarConfig: {\n                xtype: 'titlebar',\n                docked: 'top',\n                items: [{\n                    xtype: 'button',\n                    ui: 'decline',\n                    text: 'Cancel',\n                    align: 'left',\n                    action: 'cancel'\n                }, {\n                    xtype: 'button',\n                    ui: 'confirm',\n                    text: 'Submit',\n                    align: 'right',\n                    action: 'submit'\n                }]\n            },\n        },\n        store: {\n            fields: [],\n            data: [{\n                name: 'Jake'\n            }, {\n                name: 'Finn'\n            }]\n        },\n        columns: [{\n            text: 'Name',\n            dataIndex: 'name',\n            flex: 1,\n            editable: true\n        }]\n    });\n\n As you can see, you can easily modify nearly every bit of the editor window.  As mentioned\n above, the toolbar and delete button are the only components included by default.  That's\n where formConfig comes into play.\n\n By adding formConfig, you can hardcode the form that gets created when editing a row.\n There are no fields set on the form initially, so you will need to define them\n yourself.  For example, if you had a \"name\" column, and you wanted it to be editable,\n you would do something like this in your plugins object:\n\n    formConfig: {\n       items: [{\n          xtype: 'textfield',\n          name: 'name',\n          label: 'Name'\n       }]\n    }\n\n Now, upon opening the editor, you would see a textfield populated with the editable value from\n its corresponding record.\n\n If you want to alter certain form configurations, but still have the default editor fields applied, use\n the defaultFormConfig instead.\n",

        "doc": "This class provides dynamic loading support for JavaScript classes. Application code\ndoes not typically need to call `{@link Ext.Loader}` except perhaps to configure path mappings\nwhen not using [Sencha Cmd](http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/).\n\n     Ext.Loader.setPath('MyApp', 'app');\n\nWhen using Sencha Cmd, this is handled by the \"bootstrap\" provided by the application\nbuild script and such configuration is not necessary.\n\n# Typical Usage\n\nThe `{@link Ext.Loader}` is most often used behind the scenes to satisfy class references in\nclass declarations. Like so:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.view.Main', {\n         extend: 'Ext.panel.Panel',\n\n         mixins: [\n             'MyApp.util.Mixin'\n         ],\n\n         requires: [\n             'Ext.grid.Panel'\n         ],\n\n         uses: [\n             'MyApp.util.Stuff'\n         ]\n     });\n\nIn all of these cases, `{@link Ext.Loader}` is used internally to resolve these class names\nand ensure that the necessary class files are loaded.\n\nDuring development, these files are loaded individually for optimal debugging. For a\nproduction use, [Sencha Cmd](http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/) will replace\nall of these strings with the actual resolved class references because it ensures that\nthe classes are all contained in the build in the correct order. In development, these\nfiles will not be loaded until the `MyApp.view.Main` class indicates they are needed\nas shown above.\n\n# Loading Classes\n\nYou can also use `{@link Ext.Loader}` directly to load classes or files. The simplest form of\nuse is `{@link Ext#method!require Ext#require}`.\n\nFor example:\n\n     Ext.require('MyApp.view.Main', function () {\n         // On callback, the MyApp.view.Main class is now loaded\n\n         var view = new MyApp.view.Main();\n     });\n\nYou can alternatively require classes by alias or wildcard.\n\n    Ext.require('widget.window');\n\n    Ext.require(['widget.window', 'layout.border', 'Ext.data.Connection']);\n\n    Ext.require(['widget.*', 'layout.*', 'Ext.data.*']);\n\nThe callback function is optional.\n\n**Note** Using `Ext.require` at global scope will cause `{@link Ext#method!onReady Ext#onReady}` and\n`{@link Ext.app.Application#method!launch Ext.app.Application#launch}` methods to be deferred until the required classes\nare loaded. It is these cases where the callback function is most often unnecessary.\n\n## Using Excludes\n\nAlternatively, you can exclude what you don't need:\n\n    // Include everything except Ext.tree.*\n    Ext.exclude('Ext.tree.*').require('*');\n\n    // Include all widgets except widget.checkbox* (this will exclude\n    // widget.checkbox, widget.checkboxfield, widget.checkboxgroup, etc.)\n    Ext.exclude('widget.checkbox*').require('widget.*');\n\n# Dynamic Instantiation\n\nAnother feature enabled by `{@link Ext.Loader}` is instantiation using class names or aliases.\n\nFor example:\n\n     var win = Ext.create({\n         xtype: 'window',\n\n         // or\n         // xclass: 'Ext.window.Window'\n\n         title: 'Hello'\n     });\n\nThis form of creation can be useful if the type to create (`window` in the above) is\nnot known statically. Internally, `{@link Ext#method!create Ext#create}` may need to *synchronously*\nload the desired class and its requirements. Doing this will generate a warning in\nthe console:\n\n     [Ext.Loader] Synchronously loading 'Ext.window.Window'...\n\nIf you see these in your debug console, you should add the indicated class(es) to the\nappropriate `requires` array (as above) or make an `{@link Ext#method!require Ext#require}` call.\n\n\n**Note** Using `{@link Ext#method!create Ext#create}` has some performance overhead and is best reserved\nfor cases where the target class is not known until run-time.\n",

        "doc": "This class is a base class for mixins. These are classes that extend this class and are\ndesigned to be used as a `{@link #static-method!mixin mixin}` by user code.\n\nIt provides mixins with the ability to \"hook\" class methods of the classes in to which\nthey are mixed. For example, consider the `{@link #method!destroy destroy}` method pattern. If a mixin class\nhad cleanup requirements, it would need to be called as part of `{@link #method!destroy destroy}`.\n\nStarting with a basic class we might have:\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Base', {\n         destroy: function () {\n             console.log('B');\n             // cleanup\n         }\n     });\n\nA derived class would look like this:\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Derived', {\n         extend: 'Foo.bar.Base',\n\n         destroy: function () {\n             console.log('D');\n             // more cleanup\n\n             this.callParent(); // let Foo.bar.Base cleanup as well\n         }\n     });\n\nTo see how using this class help, start with a \"normal\" mixin class that also needs to\ncleanup its resources. These mixins must be called explicitly by the classes that use\nthem. For example:\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Util', {\n         destroy: function () {\n             console.log('U');\n         }\n     });\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Derived', {\n         extend: 'Foo.bar.Base',\n\n         mixins: {\n             util: 'Foo.bar.Util'\n         },\n\n         destroy: function () {\n             console.log('D');\n             // more cleanup\n\n             this.mixins.util.destroy.call(this);\n\n             this.callParent(); // let Foo.bar.Base cleanup as well\n         }\n     });\n\n     var obj = new Foo.bar.Derived();\n\n     obj.destroy();\n     // logs D then U then B\n\nThis class is designed to solve the above in simpler and more reliable way.\n\n## mixinConfig\n\nUsing `mixinConfig` the mixin class can provide \"before\" or \"after\" hooks that do not\ninvolve the derived class implementation. This also means the derived class cannot\nadjust parameters to the hook methods.\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Util', {\n         extend: 'Ext.Mixin',\n\n         mixinConfig: {\n             after: {\n                 destroy: 'destroyUtil'\n             }\n         },\n\n         destroyUtil: function () {\n             console.log('U');\n         }\n     });\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Class', {\n         mixins: {\n             util: 'Foo.bar.Util'\n         },\n\n         destroy: function () {\n             console.log('D');\n         }\n     });\n\n     var obj = new Foo.bar.Derived();\n\n     obj.destroy();\n     // logs D then U\n\n If the destruction should occur in the other order, you can use `before`:\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Util', {\n         extend: 'Ext.Mixin',\n\n         mixinConfig: {\n             before: {\n                 destroy: 'destroyUtil'\n             }\n         },\n\n         destroyUtil: function () {\n             console.log('U');\n         }\n     });\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Class', {\n         mixins: {\n             util: 'Foo.bar.Util'\n         },\n\n         destroy: function () {\n             console.log('D');\n         }\n     });\n\n     var obj = new Foo.bar.Derived();\n\n     obj.destroy();\n     // logs U then D\n\n### Chaining\n\nOne way for a mixin to provide methods that act more like normal inherited methods is\nto use an `on` declaration. These methods will be injected into the `callParent` chain\nbetween the derived and superclass. For example:\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Util', {\n         extend: 'Ext.Mixin',\n\n         mixinConfig: {\n             on: {\n                 destroy: function () {\n                     console.log('M');\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n     });\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Base', {\n         destroy: function () {\n             console.log('B');\n         }\n     });\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Derived', {\n         extend: 'Foo.bar.Base',\n\n         mixins: {\n             util: 'Foo.bar.Util'\n         },\n\n         destroy: function () {\n             this.callParent();\n             console.log('D');\n         }\n     });\n\n     var obj = new Foo.bar.Derived();\n\n     obj.destroy();\n     // logs M then B then D\n\nAs with `before` and `after`, the value of `on` can be a method name.\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Util', {\n         extend: 'Ext.Mixin',\n\n         mixinConfig: {\n             on: {\n                 destroy: 'onDestroy'\n             }\n         }\n\n         onDestroy: function () {\n             console.log('M');\n         }\n     });\n\nBecause this technique leverages `callParent`, the derived class controls the time and\nparameters for the call to all of its bases (be they `{@link #static-method!extend extend}` or `{@link #static-method!mixin mixin}` flavor).\n\n### Derivations\n\nSome mixins need to process class extensions of their target class. To do this you can\ndefine an `extended` method like so:\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Util', {\n         extend: 'Ext.Mixin',\n\n         mixinConfig: {\n             extended: function (baseClass, derivedClass, classBody) {\n                 // This function is called whenever a new \"derivedClass\" is created\n                 // that extends a \"baseClass\" in to which this mixin was mixed.\n             }\n         }\n     });\n",

        "doc": "A mixin that provides the functionality for inheritable configs. This allows linking\ncomponents and containers via a prototype-chained object for accessing inherited\nvalues.\n\n## Getting Inherited Properties\n\nA component's inherited state is used to keep track of aspects of a component's state\nthat might be influenced by its ancestors like \"collapsed\" and \"hidden\". For example:\n\n     var hidden = this.getInheritedConfig('hidden');\n\nThe above will produce `true` if this or any ancestor component has its `hidden` config\nset to `true`.\n\n## Chained Objects\n\nInheritable properties are implemented by chaining each component's inherited state\nobject to its parent container's inherited state object via the prototype. The result\nis such that if a component's `inheritedState` does not have it's own property, it\ninherits the property from the nearest ancestor that does.\n\nIn the case of a Container, two state objects are created. The primary (\"outer\") object\nis used for reading inherited properties. It is also what a child will prototype chain\nto if that child is not part of the container's `items` collection. Anything in the\n`items` collection will chain to the inheritedStateInner object instead. This object is\nprototype chained to inheritedState but allows for Container's layout to set inherited\nproperties that specifically apply only to children of the container. This inner object\nis unlikely to be needed by user code.\n\n## Publishing Inherited Properties\n\nThe first step to publishing inherited properties is to override `{@link #method!initInheritedState initInheritedState}`\nand add properties that have inheritable values.\n\n     initInheritedState: function (inheritedState) {\n         this.callParent(arguments);\n\n         if (this.getHidden()) {\n             inheritedState.hidden = true;\n         }\n     }\n\nThe above is important because `{@link #method!initInheritedState initInheritedState}` is called whenever the object needs\nto be repopulated. As you can see, only `true` values are added to `inheritedState` in\nthis case because `false` would mask a `hidden` value of `true` from an ancestor.\n\nIf these values change dynamically, these properties must be maintained. For example:\n\n     updateHidden: function (hidden) {\n         var inherited = this.getInherited();\n\n         if (hidden) {\n             inherited.hidden = true;\n         } else {\n             // Unmask whatever may be inherited:\n             delete inherited.hidden;\n         }\n     }\n\n## Proper Usage\n\nALWAYS access inherited state using `{@link #method!getInherited getInherited}` or `{@link #method!getInheritedConfig getInheritedConfig}`, not by\naccessing `inheritedState` directly.\n\nThe `inheritedState` property does not exist until the first call to `{@link #method!getInherited getInherited}`. At\nthat point `{@link #method!getInherited getInherited}` walks up the component tree to establish the `inheritedState`\nprototype chain. Additionally the `inheritedState` property should NOT be relied upon\neven after the initial call to `{@link #method!getInherited getInherited}` because it is possible for it to become\ninvalid.\n\nInvalidation typically happens when a component is moved to a new container. In such a\ncase the `inheritedState` remains invalid until the next time `{@link #method!getInherited getInherited}` is called\non the component or one of its descendants.\n",

        "doc": "NavigationView is basically a {@link Ext.Container} with a {@link Ext.layout.Card} layout, so only one view\ncan be visible at a time. However, NavigationView also adds extra functionality on top of this to allow\nyou to `push` and `pop` views at any time. When you do this, your NavigationView will automatically animate\nbetween your current active view, and the new view you want to `push`, or the previous view you want to `pop`.\n\nUsing the NavigationView is very simple. Here is a basic example of it in action:\n\n    @example\n    var view = Ext.create('Ext.NavigationView', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n\n        items: [{\n            title: 'First',\n            items: [{\n                xtype: 'button',\n                text: 'Push a new view!',\n                handler: function() {\n                    // use the push() method to push another view. It works much like\n                    // add() or setActiveItem(). it accepts a view instance, or you can give it\n                    // a view config.\n                    view.push({\n                        title: 'Second',\n                        html: 'Second view!'\n                    });\n                }\n            }]\n        }]\n    });\n\nNow, here comes the fun part: you can push any view/item into the NavigationView, at any time, and it will\nautomatically handle the animations between the two views, including adding a back button (if necessary)\nand showing the new title.\n\n    view.push({\n        title: 'A new view',\n        html: 'Some new content'\n    });\n\nAs you can see, it is as simple as calling the {@link #method!push #method-push} method, with a new view (instance or object). Done.\n\nYou can also `pop` a view at any time. This will remove the top-most view from the NavigationView, and animate back\nto the previous view. You can do this using the {@link #method!pop #method-pop} method (which requires no arguments).\n\n    view.pop();\n\n Applications that need compatibility with ##Older Android## devices will want to see the {@link #cfg!layout #layout} config for details on\n disabling navigation view animations as these devices have poor animation support and performance.\n",

When that operation succeeds, the Deferred should be resolved; if that\noperation fails, the Deferred should be rejected.\n\nEach Deferred has an associated Promise. A Promise delegates `{@link #method!then then}` calls to its\nDeferred's `{@link #method!then then}` method. In this way, access to Deferred operations are divided between\nproducer (Deferred) and consumer (Promise) roles.\n\nWhen a Deferred's `{@link #method!resolve resolve}` method is called, it fulfills with the optionally specified\nvalue. If `{@link #method!resolve resolve}` is called with a then-able (i.e.a Function or Object with a `{@link #method!then then}`\nfunction, such as another Promise) it assimilates the then-able's result; the Deferred\nprovides its own `{@link #method!resolve resolve}` and `{@link #method!reject reject}` methods as the onFulfilled or onRejected\narguments in a call to that then-able's `{@link #method!then then}` function.

Use the controls at the top left of the example\nto toggle between code mode and live preview mode (you can also edit the code and see your changes in the live\npreview):\n\n    @example miniphone preview\n    Ext.create('Ext.TabPanel', {\n        fullscreen: true,\n        tabBarPosition: 'bottom',\n\n        defaults: {\n            styleHtmlContent: true\n        },\n\n        items: [\n            {\n                title: 'Home',\n                iconCls: 'home',\n                html: 'Home Screen'\n            },\n            {\n                title: 'Contact',\n                iconCls: 'user',\n                html: 'Contact Screen'\n            }\n        ]\n    });\nOne tab was created for each of the {@link Ext.Panel} defined in the items array.

Using this config anchors the ToolTip to its target\ninstead.\n\nThis may take the following forms:\n\n- **Blank**: Defaults to aligning the element's top-left corner to the target's\n  bottom-left corner (\"tl-bl\").\n- **Two anchors**: If two values from the table below are passed separated by a dash,\n  the first value is used as the element's anchor point, and the second value is\n  used as the target's anchor point.\n- **Two edge/offset descriptors:** An edge/offset descriptor is an edge initial\n  (`t`/`r`/`b`/`l`) followed by a percentage along that side. This describes a\n  point to align with a similar point in the target. So `'t0-b0'` would be\n  the same as `'tl-bl'`, `'l0-r50'` would place the top left corner of this item\n  halfway down the right edge of the target item. This allows more flexibility\n  and also describes which two edges are considered adjacent when positioning a tip pointer.\n\nIn addition to the anchor points, the position parameter also supports the \"?\"\ncharacter. If \"?\" is passed at the end of the position string, the element will\nattempt to align as specified, but the position will be adjusted to constrain to\nthe viewport if necessary. Note that the element being aligned might be swapped to\nalign to a different position than that specified in order to enforce the viewport\nconstraints.

That is, this class does not support \"external\" keys. This\nmakes this class more efficient because it does not need to track keys in parallel with\nitems. It also means key-to-item lookup will be optimal and never need to perform a\nlinear search.\n\n### Extra Keys\n\nIn some cases items may need to be looked up by multiple property values. To enable this\nthere is the `{@link #cfg!extraKeys extraKeys}` config.\n\nFor example, to quickly look up items by their \"name\" property:\n\n     var collection = new Ext.util.Collection({\n         extraKeys: {\n             byName: 'name' // based on \"name\" property of each item\n         }\n     });\n\n## Ranges\n\nWhen methods accept index arguments to indicate a range of items, these are either an\nindex and a number of items or a \"begin\" and \"end\" index.\n\nIn the case of \"begin\" and \"end\", the \"end\" is the first item outside the range. This\ndefinition makes it simple to expression empty ranges because \"length = end - begin\".\n\n### Negative Indices\n\nWhen an item index is provided, negative values are treated as offsets from the end of\nthe collection. In other words the follow are equivalent:\n\n     +---+---+---+---+---+---+\n     |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n     +---+---+---+---+---+---+\n       0   1   2   3   4   5\n      -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1\n\n## Legacy Classes\n\nThe legacy classes `Ext.util.MixedCollection' and `{@link Ext.util.AbstractMixedCollection}`\nmay be needed if external keys are required, but for all other situations this class\nshould be used instead.\n",

This scope is\ndetermined from the `{@link #cfg!id id}` property. Further, this class does not expose the number of\nkeys in the store as a `length` property as this cannot be maintained reliably without\nundue cost. Instead there is a `{@link #method!getKeys getKeys}` method that returns the cached array of keys\nwhich is lazily populated on first call.\n\nFor example:\n\n     var store = new Ext.util.LocalStorage({\n             id: 'foo'\n         });\n\n     store.setItem('bar', 'stuff');\n\n     // Equivalent to:\n     window.localStorage.setItem('foo-bar', 'stuff');\n\nIn all cases, the `{@link #cfg!id id}` property is only used by the underlying storage and should not\nbe needed in item access calls or appear when enumerating keys.\n\nTo continue with the previous example:\n\n     var keys = store.getKeys();\n     console.log(keys.length);   // logs 1\n     console.log(store.key(0));  // logs \"bar\"\n\n## Sharing Instances\n\nThe management of the underlying storage can be broken if multiple instances of this\nclass are created with the same `{@link #cfg!id id}` simultaneously. To avoid creating multiple instances\nwith the same `{@link #cfg!id id}`, use the `{@link #static-method!get get}` method and it will lazily create and share a single\ninstance. When you are done with the shared instance, call `{@link #method!release release}`.\n\n     var storage = Ext.util.LocalStorage.get('id');\n\n     ...\n\n     storage.release(); // do not call `{@link #method!destroy destroy}` as others may be using this object\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Do not mix direction instantiation and `{@link #static-method!get get}` with the same `{@link #cfg!id id}`.\n\n## Legacy IE\n\nOlder IE browsers (specifically IE7 and below) do not support `localStorage` so this\nclass provides equivalent support using the IE proprietary persistence mechanism: the\n[`userData` behavior](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531424(VS.85).aspx).

Attempting to\nmeasure text that includes HTML may return inaccurate results.\n\nThis measurement works by copying the relevant font-related CSS styles from the element\nparam to the TextMetrics' cached measurement element.  This returns the dimensions of the cached\nelement wrapping the text.  By default, the wrapping element is auto-sized.\nYou must provide a **fixed width** if the passed text is multi-lined.\n\nWhen multiple measurements are being done with the same element styling, you should\ncreate a single, reusable TextMetrics instance.  This is more efficient than using the\nstatic {@link #static-method!measure #measure} method.  The element styles are copied to the cached\nTextMetrics element once during instantiation versus repeated copying using\n_measure()_.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the recommended use of TextMetrics where the custom\ntextfield class sets up a reusable TextMetrics instance used to measure the label\nwidth. This example assumes that all instances of _mytextfield_ have the same\n{@link Ext.form.Labelable#labelClsExtra labelClsExtra} and\n{@link Ext.form.Labelable#labelStyle labelStyle} configs.\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.view.MyTextField', {\n        extend: 'Ext.form.field.Text',\n        xtype: 'mytextfield',\n\n        initComponent: function () {\n            var me = this,\n                tm = me.getTextMetrics();\n\n            me.labelWidth = tm.getWidth(me.fieldLabel + me.labelSeparator);\n            me.callParent();\n        },\n\n        getTextMetrics: function () {\n            var me = this,\n                // Using me.self allows labelCls etc. to vary by derived\n                // class, but not by instance.\n                cls = me.self,\n                tm = cls.measurer,\n                el;\n\n            if (!tm) {\n                el = Ext.getBody().createChild();\n                el.addCls(me.labelCls + ' ' + me.labelClsExtra).\n                    applyStyles(me.labelStyle);\n\n                cls.measurer = tm = new Ext.util.TextMetrics(el);\n            }\n\n            return tm;\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        title: 'Contact Info',\n        width: 600,\n        bodyPadding: 10,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        items: [{\n            xtype: 'mytextfield',\n            fieldLabel: 'Name',\n            labelStyle: 'font-size: 10px;'\n        }, {\n            xtype: 'mytextfield',\n            fieldLabel: 'Email Address',\n            labelStyle: 'font-size: 10px;'\n        }]\n    });\n\nWhile less efficient than the preceding example, this example allows each instance of\n_mytextfield2_ to have unique labelClsExtra and labelStyle configs.  Each custom\ntextfield instance uses the static TextMetrics measure method which will copy the\nlabel styles repeatedly, thus being less efficient but more versatile.\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.view.MyTextField2', {\n        extend: 'Ext.form.field.Text',\n        xtype: 'mytextfield2',\n\n        initComponent: function () {\n            var me = this,\n                el = me.getMeasurementEl(),\n                tm = Ext.util.TextMetrics;\n\n            me.labelWidth = tm.measure(el, me.fieldLabel + me.labelSeparator).width;\n            me.callParent();\n        },\n\n        getMeasurementEl: function () {\n            var me = this,\n                cls = MyApp.view.MyTextField2,\n                el = cls.measureEl;\n\n            if (!el) {\n                cls.measureEl = el = Ext.getBody().createChild();\n            }\n\n            el.dom.removeAttribute('style');\n            el.removeCls(el.dom.className).\n                addCls(me.labelCls + ' ' + me.labelClsExtra).\n                applyStyles(me.labelStyle);\n\n            return el;\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        title: 'Contact Info',\n        width: 600,\n        bodyPadding: 10,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        items: [{\n            xtype: 'mytextfield2',\n            fieldLabel: 'Name',\n            labelStyle: 'font-size: 14px;font-weight: bold;',\n            labelClsExtra: 'nameLabel'\n        }, {\n            xtype: 'mytextfield2',\n            fieldLabel: 'Email Address',\n            labelStyle: 'font-size: 10px;',\n            labelClsExtra: 'emailLabel'\n        }]\n    });\n",

    "Ext.Version": {
        "type": "Ext.Version",
        "doc": "\nA utility class that wraps around a version number string and provides convenient methods\nto perform comparisons. A version number is expressed in the following general format:\n\n    major[.minor[.patch[.build[release]]]]\n\nThe `Version` instance holds various readonly properties that contain the digested form\nof the version string. The numeric componnets of `{@link #property!major major}`, `{@link #property!minor minor}`, `{@link #property!patch patch}` and `{@link #property!build build}`\nas well as the textual suffix called `{@link #property!release release}`.\n\nNot depicted in the above syntax are three possible prefixes used to control partial\nmatching. These are '^' (the default), '>' and '~'. These are discussed below.\n\nExamples:\n\n    var version = new Ext.Version('1.0.2beta'); // or maybe \"1.0\" or \"1.2.3.4RC\"\n    console.log(\"Version is \" + version); // Version is 1.0.2beta\n\n    console.log(version.getMajor()); // 1\n    console.log(version.getMinor()); // 0\n    console.log(version.getPatch()); // 2\n    console.log(version.getBuild()); // 0\n    console.log(version.getRelease()); // beta\n\nThe understood values of `{@link #property!release release}` are assigned numberic equivalents for the sake of\ncomparsion. The order of these from smallest to largest is as follows:\n\n * `\"dev\"`\n * `\"alpha\"` or `\"a\"`\n * `\"beta\"` or `\"b\"`\n * `\"RC\"` or `\"rc\"`\n * `\"#\"`\n * `\"pl\"` or `\"p\"`\n\nAny other (unrecognized) suffix is consider greater than any of these.\n\n## Comparisons\nThere are two forms of comparison that are commonly needed: full and partial. Full\ncomparison is simpler and is also the default.\n\nExample:\n\n    var version = new Ext.Version('1.0.2beta');\n\n    console.log(version.isGreaterThan('1.0.1')); // True\n    console.log(version.isGreaterThan('1.0.2alpha')); // True\n    console.log(version.isGreaterThan('1.0.2RC')); // False\n    console.log(version.isGreaterThan('1.0.2')); // False\n    console.log(version.isLessThan('1.0.2')); // True\n\n    console.log(version.match(1.0)); // True (using a Number)\n    console.log(version.match('1.0.2')); // True (using a String)\n\nThese comparisons are ultimately implemented by {@link Ext.Version#method!compareTo compareTo}\nwhich returns -1, 0 or 1 depending on whether the `Version' instance is less than, equal\nto, or greater than the given \"other\" version.\n\nFor example:\n\n     var n = version.compareTo('1.0.1');  // == 1  (because 1.0.2beta > 1.0.1)\n\n     n = version.compareTo('1.1');  // == -1\n     n = version.compareTo(version); // == 0\n\n### Partial Comparisons\nBy default, unspecified version number fields are filled with 0. In other words, the\nversion number fields are 0-padded on the right or a \"lower bound\". This produces the\nmost commonly used forms of comparsion:\n\n     var ver = new Version('4.2');\n\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.2.1'); // == -1  (4.2 promotes to 4.2.0 and is less than 4.2.1)\n\nThere are two other ways to interpret comparisons of versions of different length. The\nfirst of these is to change the padding on the right to be a large number (scuh as\nInfinity) instead of 0. This has the effect of making the version an upper bound. For\nexample:\n\n     var ver = new Version('^4.2'); // NOTE: the '^' prefix used\n\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.3'); // == -1  (less than 4.3)\n\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.2'); // == 1   (greater than all 4.2's)\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.2.1'); // == 1\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.2.9'); // == 1\n\nThe second way to interpret this comparison is to ignore the extra digits, making the\nmatch a prefix match. For example:\n\n     var ver = new Version('~4.2'); // NOTE: the '~' prefix used\n\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.3'); // == -1\n\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.2'); // == 0\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.2.1'); // == 0\n\nThis final form can be useful when version numbers contain more components than are\nimportant for certain comparisons. For example, the full version of Ext JS 4.2.1 is\n\"4.2.1.883\" where 883 is the `{@link #property!build build}` number.\n\nThis is how to create a \"partial\" `Version` and compare versions to it:\n\n     var version421ish = new Version('~4.2.1');\n\n     n = version421ish.compareTo('4.2.1.883'); // == 0\n     n = version421ish.compareTo('4.2.1.2'); // == 0\n     n = version421ish.compareTo('4.2.1'); // == 0\n\n     n = version421ish.compareTo('4.2'); // == 1\n\nIn the above example, '4.2.1.2' compares as equal to '4.2.1' because digits beyond the\ngiven \"4.2.1\" are ignored. However, '4.2' is less than the '4.2.1' prefix; its missing\ndigit is filled with 0.\n",

The following examples\ndemonstrate all of the supported features.\n\n# Sample Data\n\nThis is the data object used for reference in each code example:\n\n    var data = {\n        name: 'Don Griffin',\n        title: 'Senior Technomage',\n        company: 'Sencha Inc.',\n        drinks: ['Coffee', 'Water', 'More Coffee'],\n        kids: [\n            { name: 'Aubrey',  age: 17 },\n            { name: 'Joshua',  age: 13 },\n            { name: 'Cale',    age: 10 },\n            { name: 'Nikol',   age: 5 },\n            { name: 'Solomon', age: 0 }\n        ]\n    };\n\n# Auto filling of arrays\n\nThe **tpl** tag and the **for** operator are used to process the provided data object:\n\n- If the value specified in for is an array, it will auto-fill, repeating the template block inside the tpl\n  tag for each item in the array.\n- If for=\".\" is specified, the data object provided is examined.\n- If between=\"...\" is specified, the provided value will be inserted between the items.\n  This is also supported in the \"foreach\" looping template.\n- While processing an array, the special variable {#} will provide the current array index + 1 (starts at 1, not 0).\n\nExamples:\n\n    <tpl for=\".\">...</tpl>       // loop through array at root node\n    <tpl for=\"foo\">...</tpl>     // loop through array at foo node\n    <tpl for=\"foo.bar\">...</tpl> // loop through array at foo.bar node\n    <tpl for=\".\" between=\",\">...</tpl> // loop through array at root node and insert ',' between each item\n\nUsing the sample data above:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\".\">',       // process the data.kids node\n            '<p>{#}. {name}</p>',  // use current array index to autonumber\n        '</tpl></p>'\n    );\n    tpl.overwrite(panel.body, data.kids); // pass the kids property of the data object\n\nAn example illustrating how the **for** property can be leveraged to access specified members of the provided data\nobject to populate the template:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Title: {title}</p>',\n        '<p>Company: {company}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',     // interrogate the kids property within the data\n            '<p>{name}</p>',\n        '</tpl></p>'\n    );\n    tpl.overwrite(panel.body, data);  // pass the root node of the data object\n\nFlat arrays that contain values (and not objects) can be auto-rendered using the special **`{.}`** variable inside a\nloop. This variable will represent the value of the array at the current index:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>{name}\\'s favorite beverages:</p>',\n        '<tpl for=\"drinks\">',\n            '<div> - {.}</div>',\n        '</tpl>'\n    );\n    tpl.overwrite(panel.body, data);\n\nWhen processing a sub-template, for example while looping through a child array, you can access the parent object's\nmembers via the **parent** object:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '<tpl if=\"age &gt; 1\">',\n                '<p>{name}</p>',\n                '<p>Dad: {parent.name}</p>',\n            '</tpl>',\n        '</tpl></p>'\n    );\n    tpl.overwrite(panel.body, data);\n\nThe **foreach** operator is used to loop over an object's properties.  The following\nexample demonstrates looping over the main data object's properties:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<dl>',\n            '<tpl foreach=\".\">',\n                '<dt>{$}</dt>', // the special **`{$}`** variable contains the property name\n                '<dd>{.}</dd>', // within the loop, the **`{.}`** variable is set to the property value\n            '</tpl>',\n        '</dl>'\n    );\n    tpl.overwrite(panel.body, data);\n\n# Conditional processing with basic comparison operators\n\nThe **tpl** tag and the **if** operator are used to provide conditional checks for deciding whether or not to render\nspecific parts of the template.\n\nUsing the sample data above:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '<tpl if=\"age &gt; 1\">',\n                '<p>{name}</p>',\n            '</tpl>',\n        '</tpl></p>'\n    );\n    tpl.overwrite(panel.body, data);\n\nMore advanced conditionals are also supported:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '<p>{name} is a ',\n            '<tpl if=\"age &gt;= 13\">',\n                '<p>teenager</p>',\n            '<tpl elseif=\"age &gt;= 2\">',\n                '<p>kid</p>',\n            '<tpl else>',\n                '<p>baby</p>',\n            '</tpl>',\n        '</tpl></p>'\n    );\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '<p>{name} is a ',\n            '<tpl switch=\"name\">',\n                '<tpl case=\"Aubrey\" case=\"Nikol\">',\n                    '<p>girl</p>',\n                '<tpl default>',\n                    '<p>boy</p>',\n            '</tpl>',\n        '</tpl></p>'\n    );\n\nA `break` is implied between each case and default, however, multiple cases can be listed\nin a single &lt;tpl&gt; tag.\n\n# Using double quotes\n\nExamples:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        \"<tpl if='age &gt; 1 && age &lt; 10'>Child</tpl>\",\n        \"<tpl if='age &gt;= 10 && age &lt; 18'>Teenager</tpl>\",\n        \"<tpl if='this.isGirl(name)'>...</tpl>\",\n        '<tpl if=\"id == \\'download\\'\">...</tpl>',\n        \"<tpl if='needsIcon'><img src='{icon}' class='{iconCls}'/></tpl>\",\n        \"<tpl if='name == \\\"Don\\\"'>Hello</tpl>\"\n    );\n\n# Basic math support\n\nThe following basic math operators may be applied directly on numeric data values:\n\n    + - * /\n\nFor example:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '<tpl if=\"age &gt; 1\">',  // <-- Note that the > is encoded\n                '<p>{#}: {name}</p>',  // <-- Auto-number each item\n                '<p>In 5 Years: {age+5}</p>',  // <-- Basic math\n                '<p>Dad: {parent.name}</p>',\n            '</tpl>',\n        '</tpl></p>'\n    );\n    tpl.overwrite(panel.body, data);\n\n# Execute arbitrary inline code with special built-in template variables\n\nAnything between `{[ ... ]}` is considered code to be executed in the scope of the template.\nThe expression is evaluated and the result is included in the generated result. There are\nsome special variables available in that code:\n\n- **out**: The output array into which the template is being appended (using `push` to later\n  `join`).\n- **values**: The values in the current scope. If you are using scope changing sub-templates,\n  you can change what values is.\n- **parent**: The scope (values) of the ancestor template.\n- **xindex**: If you are in a \"for\" or \"foreach\" looping template, the index of the loop you are in (1-based).\n- **xcount**: If you are in a \"for\" looping template, the total length of the array you are looping.\n- **xkey**: If you are in a \"foreach\" looping template, the key of the current property\nbeing examined.\n\nThis example demonstrates basic row striping using an inline code block and the xindex variable:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Company: {[values.company.toUpperCase() + \", \" + values.title]}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '<div class=\"{[xindex % 2 === 0 ? \"even\" : \"odd\"]}\">',\n            '{name}',\n            '</div>',\n        '</tpl></p>'\n     );\n\nAny code contained in \"verbatim\" blocks (using \"{% ... %}\") will be inserted directly in\nthe generated code for the template. These blocks are not included in the output. This\ncan be used for simple things like break/continue in a loop, or control structures or\nmethod calls (when they don't produce output). The `this` references the template instance.\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Company: {[values.company.toUpperCase() + \", \" + values.title]}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '{% if (xindex % 2 === 0) continue; %}',\n            '{name}',\n            '{% if (xindex > 100) break; %}',\n            '</div>',\n        '</tpl></p>'\n     );\n\n# Template member functions\n\nOne or more member functions can be specified in a configuration object passed into the XTemplate constructor for\nmore complex processing:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '<tpl if=\"this.isGirl(name)\">',\n                '<p>Girl: {name} - {age}</p>',\n            '<tpl else>',\n                '<p>Boy: {name} - {age}</p>',\n            '</tpl>',\n            '<tpl if=\"this.isBaby(age)\">',\n                '<p>{name} is a baby!</p>',\n            '</tpl>',\n        '</tpl></p>',\n        {\n            // XTemplate configuration:\n            disableFormats: true,\n            // member functions:\n            isGirl: function(name){\n               return name == 'Aubrey' || name == 'Nikol';\n            },\n            isBaby: function(age){\n               return age < 1;\n            }\n        }\n    );\n    tpl.overwrite(panel.body, data);\n",
