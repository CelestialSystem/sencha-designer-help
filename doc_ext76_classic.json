For example {@link Ext#getCmp Ext.getCmp} aliases\n{@link Ext.ComponentManager#get Ext.ComponentManager.get}.\n\nMany applications are initiated with {@link Ext#application Ext.application} which is\ncalled once the DOM is ready. This ensures all scripts have been loaded, preventing\ndependency issues. For example:\n\n     Ext.application({\n         name: 'MyApp',\n\n         launch: function () {\n             Ext.Msg.alert(this.name, 'Ready to go!');\n         }\n     });\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/\">Sencha Cmd</a></b> is a free tool\nfor helping you generate and build Ext JS (and Sencha Touch) applications.

        "doc": "Represents an Ext JS application, which is typically a single page app using a\n{@link Ext.container.Viewport Viewport}.\n\nAn application consists of one or more Views. The behavior of a View is managed by its\ncorresponding {@link Ext.app.ViewController ViewController} and {@link Ext.app.ViewModel\nViewModel}.\n\nGlobal activities are coordinated by {@link Ext.app.Controller Controllers} which are\nultimately instantiated by an instance of this (or a derived) class.\n\n    Ext.application({\n        name: 'MyApp',\n\n        // The name of the initial view to create. With the classic toolkit this class\n        // will gain a \"viewport\" plugin if it does not extend Ext.Viewport. With the\n        // modern toolkit, the main view will be added to the Viewport.\n        //\n        //mainView: 'Main.view.main.Main'\n    });\n\nThis does several things. First it creates a global variable called 'MyApp' - all of\nyour Application's classes (such as its Models, Views and Controllers) will reside under\nthis single namespace, which drastically lowers the chances of colliding global variables.\n\nThe MyApp global will also have a getApplication method to get a reference to the current\napplication:\n\n    var app = MyApp.getApplication();\n\n# Telling Application about the rest of the app\n\nBecause an Ext.app.Application represents an entire app, we should tell it about the other\nparts of the app - namely the Models, Views and Controllers that are bundled with the\napplication. Let's say we have a blog management app; we might have Models and Controllers for\nPosts and Comments, and Views for listing, adding and editing Posts and Comments. Here's how\nwe'd tell our Application about all these things:\n\n    Ext.application({\n        name: 'Blog',\n\n        models: ['Post', 'Comment'],\n\n        controllers: ['Posts', 'Comments'],\n\n        launch: function() {\n            ...\n        }\n    });\n\nNote that we didn't actually list the Views directly in the Application itself. This is because\nViews are managed by Controllers, so it makes sense to keep those dependencies there.\nThe Application will load each of the specified Controllers using the pathing conventions\nlaid out in the [application architecture guide][1]\n- in this case expecting the controllers to reside in app/controller/Posts.js and\napp/controller/Comments.js. In turn, each Controller simply needs to list the Views it uses\nand they will be automatically loaded. Here's how our Posts controller like be defined:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.controller.Posts', {\n        extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',\n        views: ['posts.List', 'posts.Edit'],\n\n        // the rest of the Controller here\n    });\n\nBecause we told our Application about our Models and Controllers, and our Controllers about\ntheir Views, Ext JS will automatically load all of our app files for us. This means we don't\nhave to manually add script tags into our html files whenever we add a new class, but more\nimportantly it enables us to create a minimized build of our entire application using Sencha Cmd.\n\n# Deriving from Ext.app.Application\n\nTypically, applications do not derive directly from Ext.app.Application. Rather, the\nconfiguration passed to `Ext.application` mimics what you might do in a derived class.\nIn some cases, however, it can be desirable to share logic by using a derived class\nfrom `{@link Ext.app.Application}`.\n\nDerivation works as you would expect, but using the derived class should still be the\njob of the `Ext.application` method.\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.Application', {\n        extend: 'Ext.app.Application',\n        name: 'MyApp',\n        ...\n    });\n\n    Ext.application('MyApp.Application');\n\nFor more information about writing Ext JS applications, please see\nthe [application architecture guide][1].\n[1]: ../guides/application_architecture/application_architecture.html\n",

        "doc": "This class manages a formula defined for an `{@link Ext.app.ViewModel}`.\n\n## Formula Basics\n\nFormulas in a `ViewModel` can be defined as simply as just a function:\n\n     formulas: {\n         xy: function (get) { return get('x') * get('y'); }\n     }\n\nWhen you need to be more explicit, \"xy\" can become an object. The following means the\nsame thing as above:\n\n     formulas: {\n         xy: {\n             get: function (get) { return get('x') * get('y'); }\n         }\n     }\n\n### Data Dependencies\n\nOne of the important aspects of a `ViewModel` is notification of change. In order to\nmanage this, a `ViewModel` *must* know the dependencies between data. In the above case\nthis is accomplished by **parsing the text of the function**. While this is convenient\nand reduces the maintenance/risk that would come from explicitly listing dependencies\nseparately, there are some rules to be aware of:\n\n  * All dependencies are resolved by matching the binding statements in the getter function.\n  * If you need to use these values in other ways, cache them as a `var` (following\n    the first rule to capture the value) and use that `var`.\n\nIn the above formulas, the \"xy\" formula depends on \"x\" and \"y\" in the `ViewModel`. As\nthese values change, the formula is called to produce the correct value for \"xy\". This\nin turn can be used by other formulas. For example:\n\n     formulas: {\n         xy: function (get) {  // \"get\" is arbitrary but a good convention\n             return get('x') * get('y');\n         },\n\n         xyz: function (get) {\n             return get('xy') * get('z');\n         }\n     }\n\nIn the above, \"xyz\" depends on \"xy\" and \"z\" values in the `ViewModel`.\n\n### The Getter Method\n\nThe argument passed to the formula is a function that allows you to retrieve\nthe matched bind statements.\n\n     formulas: {\n         foo: function (get) {\n             return get('theUser.address.city');\n         }\n     }\n\nIn the above, the dependency is resolved to `theUser.address.city`. The formula will not\nbe triggered until the value for `city` is present.\n\n### Capturing Values\n\nIf values need to be used repeatedly, you can use a `var` as long as the Rules are not\nbroken.\n\n     formulas: {\n         x2y2: function (get) {\n             // These are still \"visible\" as \"get('x')\" and \"get('y')\" so this is OK:\n             var x = get('x'),\n                 y = get('y');\n\n             return x * x * y * y;\n         }\n     }\n\n## Explicit Binding\n\nWhile function parsing is convenient, there are times it is not the best solution. In\nthese cases, an explicit `{@link #cfg!bind bind}` can be given. To revisit the previous example with an\nexplicit binding:\n\n     formulas: {\n         zip: {\n             bind: '{foo.bar.zip}',\n\n             get: function (zip) {\n                 // NOTE: the only thing we get is what our bind produces.\n                 return zip * 2;\n             }\n         }\n     }\n\nIn this case we have given the formula an explicit `{@link #cfg!bind bind}` value so it will no longer\nparse the `{@link #cfg!get get}` function. Instead, it will call `{@link Ext.app.ViewModel#bind}` with\nthe value of the `{@link #cfg!bind bind}` property and pass the produced value to `{@link #cfg!get get}` whenever it\nchanges.\n\n## Settable Formulas\n\nWhen a formula is \"reversible\" it can be given a `{@link #cfg!set set}` method to allow it to participate\nin two-way binding. For example:\n\n     formulas: {\n            fullName: {\n                get: function (get) {\n                    var ret = get('firstName') || '';\n\n                    if (get('lastName')) {\n                        ret += ' ' +  get('lastName');\n                    }\n\n                    return ret;\n                },\n\n                set: function (value) {\n                    var space = value.indexOf(' '),\n                        split = (space < 0) ? value.length : space;\n\n                    this.set({\n                        firstName: value.substring(0, split),\n                        lastName: value.substring(split + 1)\n                    });\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\nWhen the `{@link #cfg!set set}` method is called the `this` reference is the `{@link Ext.app.ViewModel}` so it\njust calls its `{@link Ext.app.ViewModel#method-set set method}`.\n\n## Single Run Formulas\n\nIf a formula only needs to produce an initial value, it can be marked as `{@link #cfg!single single}`.\n\n     formulas: {\n         xy: {\n             single: true,\n\n             get: function (get) {\n                 return get('x') * get('y');\n             }\n         }\n     }\n\nThis formulas `{@link #cfg!get get}` method will be called with `x` and `y` once and then its binding\nto these properties will be destroyed. This means the `{@link #cfg!get get}` method (and hence the value\nof `xy`) will only be executed/calculated once.\n",

        "type": "Ext.app.Controller",
        "doc": "Controllers are the glue that binds an application together. That said, their main\npurpose is to listen for events (usually from views) and take some action. Here's how\nwe might create a Controller to manage Users:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.controller.Users', {\n         extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',\n\n         init: function() {\n             console.log('Initialized Users! This happens before ' +\n                         'the Application launch() function is called');\n         }\n     });\n\nThe init function is a special method that is called when your application boots. It is\ncalled before the {@link Ext.app.Application Application}'s launch function is executed.\nThis creates an area you can run code prior to Viewport creation.\n\nThe controller's {@link #method-control} function\nmakes it easy to listen to events on your view classes and take some action with a\nhandler function. Let's update our Users controller to tell us when the panel is\nrendered:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.controller.Users', {\n         extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',\n\n         control: {\n             'viewport > panel': {\n                 render: 'onPanelRendered'\n             }\n         }\n\n         onPanelRendered: function() {\n             console.log('The panel was rendered');\n         }\n     });\n\nThe {@link Ext.app.BaseController#method-control control method} has now set up\nlisteners on views in our application. The control method uses the ComponentQuery\nengine to quickly and easily get references to components on the page. If you are not\nfamiliar with ComponentQuery yet, be sure to check out the\n{@link Ext.ComponentQuery documentation}. In brief, it allows us to pass a\nCSS-like selector that will find every matching component on the page.\n\nIn our init function above, we supplied 'viewport > panel', which translates to \"find me\nevery Panel that is a direct child of a Viewport\". We then supplied an object that maps\nevent names (just 'render' in this case) to handler functions. In short, whenever\na component that matches our selector fires a 'render' event, our\nonPanelRendered function is called.\n\n## Event domains\n\nIn Ext JS 4.2, we introduced the concept of event domains. In terms of MVC, an event\ndomain is one or more base classes that fire events to which a Controller wants to\nlisten. Besides Component event domain that encompass {@link Ext.Component}-descended\nViews, Controllers now can listen to events from data Stores, Ext Direct Providers,\nother Controllers, and Ext.GlobalEvents. This feature provides a way to communicate\nbetween parts of the whole application without the need to bind controllers together\ntightly, and allows to develop and test application parts in isolation.\n\nSee usage examples in {@link #method-listen} method documentation.\n\n## Using refs\n\nOne of the most useful parts of Controllers is the ref system. These use\n{@link Ext.ComponentQuery} to make it really easy to get references to Views on your\npage. Let's look at an example of this now:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.controller.Users', {\n         extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',\n\n         refs: [{\n             ref: 'list',\n             selector: 'grid'\n         }],\n\n         control: {\n             'button': {\n                 click: 'refreshGrid'\n             }\n         },\n\n         refreshGrid: function() {\n             this.getList().store.load();\n         }\n     });\n\nThis example assumes the existence of a {@link Ext.grid.Panel Grid} on the page, which\ncontains a single button to refresh the Grid when clicked. In our refs array, we set up\na reference to the grid. There are two parts to this - the 'selector', which is a\n{@link Ext.ComponentQuery ComponentQuery} selector which finds any grid on the page and\nassigns it to the reference 'list'.\n\nBy giving the reference a name, we get a number of things for free. The first is the\ngetList function that we use in the refreshGrid method above. This is generated\nautomatically by the Controller based on the name of our ref, which was capitalized and\nprepended with get to go from 'list' to 'getList'.\n\nThe way this works is that the first time getList is called by your code, the\nComponentQuery selector is run and the first component that matches the selector\n('grid' in this case) will be returned. All future calls to getList will use a cached\nreference to that grid. Usually it is advised to use a specific ComponentQuery selector\nthat will only match a single View in your application (in the case above our selector\nwill match any grid on the page).\n\nBringing it all together, we configure control\nto listen to any click on a {@link Ext.button.Button button} and call our refreshGrid\nfunction (again, this will match any button on the page so we advise a more specific\nselector than just 'button', but have left it this way for simplicity). When the button\nis clicked we use out getList function to refresh the grid.\n\nYou can create any number of refs and control any number of components this way, simply\nadding more functions to your Controller as you go. For an example of real-world usage\nof Controllers see the Feed Viewer example in the examples/app/feed-viewer folder in\nthe SDK download.\n\n## Generated getter methods\n\nRefs aren't the only thing that generate convenient getter methods. Controllers often\nhave to deal with Models and Stores so the framework offers a couple of easy ways to\nget access to those too. Let's look at another example:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.controller.Users', {\n         extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',\n\n         models: ['User'],\n         stores: ['AllUsers', 'AdminUsers'],\n\n         init: function() {\n             var User, allUsers, ed;\n\n             User = this.getUserModel();\n             allUsers = this.getAllUsersStore();\n\n             ed = new User({ name: 'Ed' });\n             allUsers.add(ed);\n         }\n     });\n\nBy specifying Models and Stores that the Controller cares about, it again dynamically\nloads them from the appropriate locations (app/model/User.js, app/store/AllUsers.js and\napp/store/AdminUsers.js in this case) and creates getter functions for them all. The\nexample above will create a new User model instance and add it to the AllUsers Store.\nOf course, you could do anything in this function but in this case we just did\nsomething simple to demonstrate the functionality.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nFor more information about writing Ext JS 5 applications, please see the\n[Application Architecture](../../../application_architecture/application_architecture.html).\nAlso see the {@link Ext.app.Application} documentation.\n",

It can also define\na {@link #launch} function that will be called after all of its dependencies have been loaded,\njust before the {@link Ext.app.Application#launch application launch} function is called.\n\n## Sample Usage\n\nFirst you need to tell your Application about your Profile(s):\n\n    Ext.application({\n        name: 'MyApp',\n        profiles: ['Phone', 'Tablet']\n    });\n\nThis will load app/profile/Phone.js and app/profile/Tablet.js. Here's how we might define the\nPhone profile:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.profile.Phone', {\n        extend: 'Ext.app.Profile',\n\n        views: ['Main'],\n\n        isActive: function() {\n            return Ext.os.is('Phone');\n        }\n    });\n\nThe isActive function returns true if we detect that we are running on a phone device. If that\nis the case the Application will set this Profile active and load the 'Main' view specified\nin the Profile's {@link #views} config.\n\n## Class Specializations\n\nBecause Profiles are specializations of an application, all of the models, views, controllers\nand stores defined in a Profile are expected to be namespaced under the name of the Profile.\nHere's an expanded form of the example above:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.profile.Phone', {\n        extend: 'Ext.app.Profile',\n\n        views: ['Main'],\n        controllers: ['Signup'],\n        models: ['MyApp.model.Group'],\n\n        isActive: function() {\n            return Ext.os.is('Phone');\n        }\n    });\n\nIn this case, the Profile is going to load *app/view/phone/Main.js*,\n*app/controller/phone/Signup.js* and *app/model/Group.js*. Notice that in each of the first\ntwo cases the name of the profile ('phone' in this case) was injected into the class names.\nIn the third case we specified the full Model name (for Group) so the Profile name was not\ninjected.\n\nFor a fuller understanding of the ideas behind Profiles and how best to use them in your app,\nwe suggest you read the [device profiles guide](/touch/2.4/core_concepts/device_profiles.html).\n",

        "type": "Ext.app.ViewModel",
        "doc": "This class manages arbitrary data and its relationship to data models. Instances of\n`ViewModel` are associated with some `Component` and then used by their child items\nfor the purposes of Data Binding.\n\n# Binding\n\nThe most commonly used aspect of a `ViewModel` is the `{@link #method!bind bind}` method. This method takes\na \"bind descriptor\" (see below) and a callback to call when the data indicated by the\nbind descriptor either becomes available or changes.\n\nThe `{@link #method!bind bind}` method, based on the bind descriptor given, will return different types of\n\"binding\" objects. These objects maintain the connection between the requested data and\nthe callback. Bindings ultimately derive from `{@link Ext.app.bind.BaseBinding}`\nwhich provides several methods to help manage the binding.\n\nPerhaps the most important method is `{@link #method!destroy destroy}`. When the binding is no longer needed\nit is important to remember to `{@link #method!destroy destroy}` it. Leaking bindings can cause performance\nproblems or worse when callbacks are called at unexpected times.\n\nThe types of bindings produced by `{@link #method!bind bind}` are:\n\n  * `{@link Ext.app.bind.Binding}`\n  * `{@link Ext.app.bind.Multi}`\n  * `{@link Ext.app.bind.TemplateBinding}`\n\n## Bind Descriptors\n\nA \"bind descriptor\" is a value (a String, an Object or an array of these) that describe\nthe desired data. Any piece of data in the `ViewModel` can be described by a bind\ndescriptor.\n\n### Textual Bind Descriptors\n\nThe simplest and most common form of bind descriptors are strings that look like an\n`{@link Ext.Template}` containing text and tokens surrounded by \"{}\" with dot notation inside\nto traverse objects and their properties.\n\nFor example:\n\n  * `'Hello {user.name}!'`\n  * `'You have selected \"{selectedItem.text}\".'`\n  * `'{!isDisabled}'`\n  * `'{a > b ? \"Bigger\" : \"Smaller\"}'`\n  * `'{user.groups}'`\n\nAll except the last are `{@link Ext.app.bind.TemplateBinding template bindings}`\nwhich use the familiar `{@link Ext.Template}` syntax with some slight differences. For more on\ntemplates see `{@link Ext.app.bind.Template}`.\n\nThe last descriptor is called a \"direct bind descriptor\". This special form of\nbind maps one-to-one to some piece of data in the `ViewModel` and is managed by the\n`{@link Ext.app.bind.Binding}` class.\n\n#### Two-Way Descriptors\n\nA direct bind descriptor may be able to write back a value to the `ViewModel` as well\nas retrieve one. When this is the case, they are said to be \"two-way\". For example:\n\n     var binding = viewModel.bind('{s}', function(s) { console.log('s=' + s); });\n\n     binding.setValue('abc');\n\nDirect use of `ViewModel` in this way is not commonly needed because `{@link Ext.Component}`\nautomates this process. For example, a `textfield` component understands when it is\ngiven a \"two-way\" binding and automatically synchronizes its value bidirectionally using\nthe above technique. For example:\n\n     Ext.widget({\n         items: [{\n             xtype: 'textfield',\n             bind: '{s}'  // a two-way / direct bind descriptor\n         }]\n     });\n\n### Object and Array Descriptors / Multi-Bind\n\nWith two exceptions (see below) an Object is interpreted as a \"shape\" to produce by\ntreating each of its properties as individual bind descriptors. An object of the same\nshape is passed as the value of the bind except that each property is populated with\nthe appropriate value. Of course, this definition is recursive, so these properties\nmay also be objects.\n\nFor example:\n\n     viewModel.bind({\n             x: '{x}',\n             foo: {\n                 bar: 'Hello {foo.bar}'\n             }\n         },\n         function (obj) {\n             //  obj = {\n             //      x: 42,\n             //      foo: {\n             //          bar: 'Hello foobar'\n             //      }\n             //  }\n         });\n\nArrays are handled in the same way. Each element of the array is considered a bind\ndescriptor (recursively) and the value produced for the binding is an array with each\nelement set to the bound property.\n\n### Bind Options\n\nOne exception to the \"object is a multi-bind\" rule is when that object contains a\n`bindTo` property. When an object contains a `bindTo` property the object is understood\nto contain bind options and the value of `bindTo` is considered the actual bind\ndescriptor.\n\nFor example:\n\n     viewModel.bind({\n             bindTo: '{x}',\n             single: true\n         },\n         function (x) {\n             console.log('x: ' + x); // only called once\n         });\n\nThe available bind options depend on the type of binding, but since all bindings\nderive from `{@link Ext.app.bind.BaseBinding}` its options are always applicable.\nFor a list of the other types of bindings, see above.\n\n#### Deep Binding\n\nWhen a direct bind is made and the bound property is an object, by default the binding\ncallback is only called when that reference changes. This is the most efficient way to\nunderstand a bind of this type, but sometimes you may need to be notified if any of the\nproperties of that object change.\n\nTo do this, we create a \"deep bind\":\n\n     viewModel.bind({\n             bindTo: '{someObject}',\n             deep: true\n         },\n         function (someObject) {\n             // called when reference changes or *any* property changes\n         });\n\n#### Binding Timings\n\nThe `ViewModel` has a {@link #scheduler} attached that is used to coordinate the firing of\nbindings.\nIt serves 2 main purposes:\n- To coordinate dependencies between bindings. This means bindings will be fired in an order\nsuch that the any dependencies for a binding are fired before the binding itself.\n- To batch binding firings. The scheduler runs on a short timer, so the following code will\nonly trigger a single binding (the last), the changes in between will never be triggered.\n\nExample:\n\n    viewModel.bind('{val}', function(v) {\n        console.log(v);\n    });\n    viewModel.set('val', 1);\n    viewModel.set('val', 2);\n    viewModel.set('val', 3);\n    viewModel.set('val', 4);\n\nThe `ViewModel` can be forced to process by calling `{@link #notify}`, which will force the\nscheduler to run immediately in the current state.\n\n    viewModel.bind('{val}', function(v) {\n        console.log(v);\n    });\n    viewModel.set('val', 1);\n    viewModel.notify();\n    viewModel.set('val', 2);\n    viewModel.notify();\n    viewModel.set('val', 3);\n    viewModel.notify();\n    viewModel.set('val', 4);\n    viewModel.notify();\n\n\n#### Models, Stores and Associations\n\nA {@link Ext.data.Session Session} manages model instances and their associations.\nThe `ViewModel` may be used with or without a `Session`. When a `Session` is attached, the\n`ViewModel` will always consult the `Session` to ask about records and stores. The `Session`\nensures that only a single instance of each model Type/Id combination is created. This is\nimportant when tracking changes in models so that we always have the same reference.\n\nA `ViewModel` provides functionality to easily consume the built in data package types\n{@link Ext.data.Model} and {@link Ext.data.Store}, as well as their associations.\n\n### Model Links\n\nA model can be described declaratively using {@link #links}. In the example code below,\nWe ask the `ViewModel` to construct a record of type `User` with `id: 17`. The model will be\nloaded from the server and the bindings will trigger once the load has completed. Similarly,\nwe could also attach a model instance to the `ViewModel` data directly.\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.model.User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['name']\n    });\n\n    var rec = new MyApp.model.User({\n        id: 12,\n        name: 'Foo'\n    });\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        links: {\n            theUser: {\n                type: 'User',\n                id: 17\n            }\n        },\n        data: {\n            otherUser: rec\n        }\n    });\n    viewModel.bind('{theUser.name}', function(v) {\n        console.log(v);\n    });\n    viewModel.bind('{otherUser.name}', function(v) {\n        console.log(v);\n    });\n\n### Model Fields\n\nBindings have the functionality to inspect the parent values and resolve the underlying\nvalue dynamically. This behavior allows model fields to be interrogated as part of a binding.\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.model.User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['name', 'age']\n    });\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        links: {\n            theUser: {\n                type: 'User',\n                id: 22\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    // Server responds with:\n    {\n        \"id\": 22,\n        \"name\": \"Foo\",\n        \"age\": 100\n    }\n\n    viewModel.bind('Hello {name}, you are {age} years old', function(v) {\n        console.log(v);\n    });\n\n### Record Properties\n\nIt is possible to bind to the certain state properties of a record. The available options are:\n- `{@link Ext.data.Model#property-dirty dirty}`\n- `{@link Ext.data.Model#property-phantom phantom}`\n- `{@link Ext.data.Model#method-isValid valid}`\n\nExample usage:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.model.User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'name',\n            validators: 'presence'\n        }, {\n            name: 'age',\n            validators: {\n               type: 'range',\n                min: 0\n             }\n        }]\n    });\n\n    var rec = new MyApp.model.User();\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        data: {\n            theUser: rec\n        }\n    });\n\n    viewModel.bind({\n        dirty: '{theUser.dirty}',\n        phantom: '{theUser.phantom}',\n        valid: '{theUser.valid}'\n    }, function(v) {\n        console.log(v.dirty, v.valid);\n    });\n\n    rec.set('name', 'Foo');\n    viewModel.notify(); // dirty, not valid\n    rec.set('age', 20);\n    viewModel.notify(); // dirty, valid\n    rec.reject();\n    viewModel.notify(); // not dirty, not valid\n\n### Advanced Record Binding\n\nFor accessing other record information that is not exposed by the binding API, formulas\ncan be used to achieve more advanced operations:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.model.User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['name', 'age']\n    });\n\n    var rec = new MyApp.model.User();\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        formulas: {\n            isNameModified: {\n                bind: {\n                    bindTo: '{theUser}',\n                    deep: true\n                },\n                get: function(rec) {\n                    return rec.isModified('name');\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        data: {\n            theUser: rec\n        }\n    });\n\n    viewModel.bind('{isNameModified}', function(modified) {\n        console.log(modified);\n    });\n    rec.set('name', 'Foo');\n\n### Associations\n\nIn the same way as fields, the bindings can also traverse associations in a bind statement.\nThe `ViewModel` will handle the asynchronous loading of data and only present the value once\nthe full path has been loaded. For more information on associations see\n{@link Ext.data.schema.OneToOne OneToOne} and {@link Ext.data.schema.ManyToOne ManyToOne}\nassociations.\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['name']\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('Order', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['date', {\n            name: 'userId',\n            reference: 'User'\n        }]\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('OrderItem', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['price', 'qty', {\n            name: 'orderId',\n            reference: 'Order'\n        }]\n    });\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        links: {\n            orderItem: {\n                type: 'OrderItem',\n                id: 13\n            }\n        }\n    });\n    // The viewmodel will handle both ways of loading the data:\n    // a) If the data is loaded inline in a nested fashion it will\n    //    not make requests for extra data\n    // b) Only loading a single model at a time. So the Order will be loaded once\n    //    the OrderItem returns. The User will be loaded once the Order loads.\n    viewModel.bind('{orderItem.order.user.name}', function(name) {\n        console.log(name);\n    });\n\n### Stores\n\nStores can be created as part of the `ViewModel` definition. The definitions are processed\nlike bindings which allows for very powerful dynamic functionality.\n\nIt is important to ensure that you name viewModel's data keys uniquely. If data is not named\nuniquely, binds and formulas may receive information from an unintended data source.\nThis applies to keys in the viewModel's data block, stores, and links configs.\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        stores: {\n            users: {\n                model: 'User',\n                autoLoad: true,\n                filters: [{\n                    property: 'createdDate',\n                    value: '{createdFilter}',\n                    operator: '>'\n                }]\n            }\n        }\n    });\n    // Later on in our code, we set the date so that the store is created.\n    viewModel.set('createdFilter', Ext.Date.subtract(new Date(), Ext.Date.DAY, 7));\n\nSee {@link #stores} for more detail.\n\n### Store Properties\n\nIt is possible to bind to the certain state properties of the store. The available options are:\n- `{@link Ext.data.Store#method-getCount count}`\n- `{@link Ext.data.Store#method-first}`\n- `{@link Ext.data.Store#method-last}`\n- `{@link Ext.data.Store#method-hasPendingLoad loading}`\n- `{@link Ext.data.Store#method-getTotalCount totalCount}`\n\nExample:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.model.User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['name']\n    });\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        stores: {\n            users: {\n                model: 'MyApp.model.User',\n                data: [{\n                    name: 'Foo'\n                }, {\n                    name: 'Bar'\n                }]\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    viewModel.bind('{users.first}', function(first) {\n        console.log(first ? first.get('name') : 'Nobody');\n    });\n\n    var timer = Ext.interval(function() {\n        var store = viewModel.getStore('users');\n        if (store.getCount()) {\n            store.removeAt(0);\n        } else {\n            Ext.uninterval(timer);\n        }\n    }, 100);\n\n### Advanced Store Binding\n\nFor accessing other store information that is not exposed by the binding API, formulas\ncan be used to achieve more advanced operations:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.model.User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['name', 'score']\n    });\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        stores: {\n            users: {\n                model: 'MyApp.model.User',\n                data: [{\n                    name: 'Foo',\n                    score: 100\n                }, {\n                    name: 'Bar',\n                    score: 350\n                }]\n            }\n        },\n        formulas: {\n            totalScore: {\n                bind: {\n                    bindTo: '{users}',\n                    deep: true\n                },\n                get: function(store) {\n                    return store.sum('score');\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    viewModel.bind('{totalScore}', function(score) {\n        console.log(score);\n    });\n\n    viewModel.notify();\n    viewModel.getStore('users').removeAll();\n\n#### Formulas\n\nFormulas allow for calculated `ViewModel` data values. The dependencies for these formulas\nare automatically determined so that the formula will not be processed until the required\ndata is present.\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        formulas: {\n            fullName: function(get) {\n                return get('firstName') + ' ' + get('lastName');\n            }\n        },\n        data: {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Smith'}\n    });\n\n    viewModel.bind('{fullName}', function(v) {\n        console.log(v);\n    });\n\nSee {@link #formulas} for more detail.\n\n#### Inheriting Data With Nesting\n\nViewModels can have a {@link #parent} which allows values to be consumed from\na shared base. These values that are available from the {@link #parent} are not copied,\nrather they are \"inherited\" in a similar fashion to a javascript closure scope chain.\nThis is demonstrated in the example below:\n\n    var parent = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        data: {\n            foo: 3\n        }\n    });\n    var child = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        parent: parent\n    });\n\nThis is analogous to the following javascript closure:\n\n    var foo = 3;\n    Ext.Ajax.request({\n        success: function() {\n            // foo is available here\n        }\n    });\n\n### Climbing/Inheriting\n\nIn line with the above, the default behaviour when setting the value of a child ViewModel\n(either) through {@link #set} or {@link Ext.app.bind.Binding#method-setValue} is to climb to\nwhere the value  is \"owned\" and set the value there:\n\n    var parent = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        data: {\n            foo: 3\n        }\n    });\n    var child = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        parent: parent\n    });\n\n    child.set('foo', 100); // Climbs to set the value on parent\n    console.log(parent.get('foo')); // 100\n    parent.set('foo', 200);\n    console.log(child.get('foo')); // 200, inherited from the parent\n\nAny subsequent sets are also inherited in the same fashion. The inheriting/climbing behavior\noccurs for any arbitrary depth, climbing/inherting can owned by a parent at any level above.\n\n    function log() {\n        console.log([a, b, c, d, e].map(function(vm) {\n            return vm.get('foo');\n        }));\n    }\n\n    var a = new Ext.app.ViewModel({data: {foo: 3}}),\n        b = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: a}),\n        c = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: b}),\n        d = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: c}),\n        e = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: d});\n\n    log(); // [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\n    e.set('foo', 100);\n    log(); // [100, 100, 100, 100, 100]\n\nThis same climbing behavior applies when setting a value on a binding. The climbing begins from\nthe ViewModel where the binding was attached:\n\n    function log() {\n        console.log([a, b, c].map(function(vm) {\n            return vm.get('foo');\n        }));\n    }\n\n    var a = new Ext.app.ViewModel({data: {foo: 3}}),\n        b = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: a}),\n        c = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: b});\n\n    var bind = c.bind('{foo}', function() {});\n\n    bind.setValue(100);\n    log(); // [100, 100, 100]\n\nThe exception to this rule is when there is nothing above to climb to. If a value is set and\nthere is no parent above to hold it, then the value is set where it was called:\n\n    function log() {\n        console.log([a, b, c].map(function(vm) {\n            return vm.get('foo');\n        }));\n    }\n\n    var a = new Ext.app.ViewModel(),\n        b = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: a}),\n        c = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: b});\n\n    c.set('foo', 3);\n    log(); // [null, null, 3]\n\n    b.set('foo', 2);\n    log(); // [null, 2, 3]\n\n    a.set('foo', 1);\n    log(); // [1, 2, 3]\n\nThese values are called local values, which are discussed below.\n\n### Local Values\n\nIf the child ViewModel is declared with top level data that also exists in the parent, then that\nchild is considered to own that local value, so no value is inherited from the parent, nor does\nthe climbing behaviour occur.\n\n    var parent = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        data: {\n            foo: 3\n        }\n    });\n    var child = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        parent: parent,\n        data: {\n            foo: 5\n        }\n    });\n\n    console.log(parent.get('foo'), child.get('foo')); // 3, 5\n    child.set('foo', 100);\n    console.log(parent.get('foo'), child.get('foo')); // 3, 100\n    parent.set('foo', 200);\n    console.log(parent.get('foo'), child.get('foo')); // 200, 100\n\nThe inheriting/climbing behavior is limited to local values:\n\n    function log() {\n        console.log([a, b, c, d, e].map(function(vm) {\n            return vm.get('foo');\n        }));\n    }\n\n    var a = new Ext.app.ViewModel({data: {foo: 1}}),\n        b = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: a}),\n        c = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: b, data: {foo: 2}}),\n        d = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: c}),\n        e = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: d, data: {foo: 3}});\n\n    log(); // [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n\n    e.set('foo', 100);\n    log(); // [1, 1, 2, 2, 100]\n\n    d.set('foo', 200);\n    log(); // [1, 1, 200, 200, 100]\n\n    c.set('foo', 201);\n    log(); // [1, 1, 201, 201, 100]\n\n    b.set('foo', 300);\n    log(); // [300, 300, 201, 201, 100]\n\n    a.set('foo', 301);\n    log(); // [301, 301, 201, 201, 100]\n\n### Attaching/Clearing Local Values Dynamically\n\nTo bypass the climbing behaviour and push a value into a particular point\nin the hierarchy, the {@link #setData} method should be used. Once a local value\nis set, it will be used as such in the future.\n\n    function log() {\n        console.log([a, b, c, d, e].map(function(vm) {\n            return vm.get('foo');\n        }));\n    }\n\n    var a = new Ext.app.ViewModel({data: {foo: 3}}),\n        b = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: a}),\n        c = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: b}),\n        d = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: c}),\n        e = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: d});\n\n    log(); // [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\n    c.setData({\n        foo: 100\n    });\n\n    log(); // [3, 3, 100, 100, 100]\n\n    d.set('foo', 200); // Climbs to new local value\n    log(); // [3, 3, 200, 200, 200]\n\nSimilarly, data can be cleared from being a local value by setting the value to undefined:\n\n    function log() {\n        console.log([a, b, c, d].map(function(vm) {\n            return vm.get('foo');\n        }));\n    }\n\n    var a = new Ext.app.ViewModel({data: {foo: 3}}),\n        b = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: a}),\n        c = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: b, data: {foo: 100}}),\n        d = new Ext.app.ViewModel({parent: c});\n\n    log(); // [3, 3, 100, 100]\n\n    c.setData({\n        foo: undefined\n    });\n    log([3, 3, 3, 3]);\n",

Subsequently, once we change the group value, the old\nfilter will be overwritten with the new value.\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        stores: {\n            users: {\n                model: 'User',\n                filters: [{\n                    property: 'groupId',\n                    value: '{groupId}'\n                }]\n            }\n        }\n    });\n    viewModel.set('groupId', 1); // This will trigger the store creation with the filter.\n    viewModel.set('groupId', 2); // The filter value will be changed.\n\nThis store uses {@link Ext.data.ChainedStore store chaining} to create a store backed by\nthe data in another store. By specifying a string as the store, it will bind our creation\nand backing to the other store. This functionality is especially useful when wanting to\ndisplay a different \"view\" of a store, for example a different sort order or different\nfilters.\n\n    var viewModel = new Ext.app.ViewModel({\n        stores: {\n            allUsers: {\n                model: 'User',\n                autoLoad: true\n            },\n            children: {\n                source: '{allUsers}',\n                filters: [{\n                    property: 'age',\n                    value: 18,\n                    operator: '<'\n                }]\n            }\n        }\n    });\n",

Customizations include {@link #iconAlign aligned}\n{@link #iconCls icons}, {@link #cfg-menu dropdown menus}, {@link #tooltip tooltips}\nand {@link #scale sizing options}. Specify a {@link #handler handler} to run code when\na user clicks the button, or use {@link #listeners listeners} for other events such as\n{@link #mouseover mouseover}. Example usage:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.Button', {\n        text: 'Click me',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        handler: function() {\n            alert('You clicked the button!');\n        }\n    });\n\nThe {@link #handler} configuration can also be updated dynamically using the {@link #setHandler}\nmethod.  Example usage:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.Button', {\n        text    : 'Dynamic Handler Button',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        handler : function() {\n            // this button will spit out a different number every time you click it.\n            // so firstly we must check if that number is already set:\n            if (this.clickCount) {\n                // looks like the property is already set, so lets just add 1 to that number\n                // and alert the user\n                this.clickCount++;\n                alert('You have clicked the button \"' + this.clickCount +\n                      '\" times.\\n\\nTry clicking it again..');\n            } else {\n                // if the clickCount property is not set, we will set it and alert the user\n                this.clickCount = 1;\n                alert('You just clicked the button for the first time!\\n\\n' +\n                      'Try pressing it again..');\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nA button within a container:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.Container', {\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        items   : [\n            {\n                xtype: 'button',\n                text : 'My Button'\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n\nA useful option of Button is the {@link #scale} configuration. This configuration has three\ndifferent options:\n\n- `'small'`\n- `'medium'`\n- `'large'`\n\nExample usage:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.Button', {\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        text    : 'Click me',\n        scale   : 'large'\n    });\n\nButtons can also be toggled. To enable this, you simple set the {@link #enableToggle} property\nto `true`.\nExample usage:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.Button', {\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        text: 'Click Me',\n        enableToggle: true\n    });\n\nYou can assign a menu to a button by using the {@link #cfg-menu} configuration. This standard\nconfiguration can either be a reference to a {@link Ext.menu.Menu menu} object,\na {@link Ext.menu.Menu menu} id or a {@link Ext.menu.Menu menu} config blob. When assigning\na menu to a button, an arrow is automatically added to the button. You can change the alignment\nof the arrow using the {@link #arrowAlign} configuration on button.\nExample usage:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.Button', {\n        text      : 'Menu button',\n        renderTo  : Ext.getBody(),\n        arrowAlign: 'bottom',\n        menu      : [\n            {text: 'Item 1'},\n            {text: 'Item 2'},\n            {text: 'Item 3'},\n            {text: 'Item 4'}\n        ]\n    });\n\nUsing listeners, you can easily listen to events fired by any component, using the\n{@link #listeners} configuration or using the {@link #addListener} method.\nButton has a variety of different listeners:\n\n- `click`\n- `toggle`\n- `{@link #event!mouseover mouseover}`\n- `{@link #event!mouseout mouseout}`\n- `mouseshow`\n- `{@link #event!menuhide menuhide}`\n- `{@link #event!menutriggerover menutriggerover}`\n- `{@link #event!menutriggerout menutriggerout}`\n\nExample usage:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.Button', {\n        text     : 'Button',\n        renderTo : Ext.getBody(),\n        listeners: {\n            click: function() {\n                // this == the button, as we are in the local scope\n                this.setText('I was clicked!');\n            },\n            mouseover: function() {\n                // set a new config which says we moused over, if not already set\n                if (!this.mousedOver) {\n                    this.mousedOver = true;\n                    alert('You moused over a button!\\n\\nI wont do this again.');\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n",

Accepted keys are:\n\n- `panX`\n- `panY`\n- `pinchZoom`\n- `doubleTapZoom`\n\nAll touch actions are enabled (`true`) by default, so it is usually only necessary\nto specify which touch actions to disable.  For example, the following disables\nonly horizontal scrolling and pinch-to-zoom on the component's main element:\n\n    touchAction: {\n        panX: false,\n        pinchZoom: false\n    }\n\nTouch actions can be specified on reference elements using the reference element\nname, for example:\n\n    // disables horizontal scrolling on the main element, and double-tap-zoom\n    // on the child element named \"body\"\n    touchAction: {\n        panY: false\n        body: {\n            doubleTapZoom: false\n        }\n    }\n\nThe primary motivation for setting the touch-action of an element is to prevent\nthe browser's default handling of a gesture such as pinch-to-zoom, or\ndrag-to-scroll, so that the application can implement its own handling of that\ngesture on the element.  Suppose, for example, a component has a custom drag\nhandler on its element and wishes to prevent horizontal scrolling of its container\nwhile it is being dragged:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.Widget', {\n        touchAction: {\n            panX: false\n        },\n        listeners: {\n            drag: function(e) {\n                // implement drag logic\n            }\n        }\n    });\n",

A different timezone offset can be specified using the view's\n{@link Ext.calendar.view.Base#cfg-timezoneOffset timezoneOffset} config option.\n\n### Sample Response\n\nBelow is a sample response from a remote source providing a single event for a source\ncalendar with an id of 1:\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1001,\n        \"calendarId\": 1,\n        \"startDate\": \"2016-09-30T21:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"endDate\": \"2016-09-30T22:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"title\": \"Watch cartoons\",\n        \"description\": \"Catch up with adventurers Finn and Jake\"\n    }]\n\nSample response for the same source calendar with an all day event on Sept. 30th 2016\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1001,\n        \"calendarId\": 1,\n        \"startDate\": \"2016-09-30T00:00:00.000Z\",\n        \"endDate\": \"2016-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n        \"allDay\": true,\n        \"title\": \"Netflix Binge\",\n        \"description\": \"Watch Luke Cage.  Maybe twice.\"\n    }]\n\n**Note:** The \"id\"s for all events must be unique within a calendar store across all\nevent stores.  Duplicate \"id\"s even across event stores may result in unintended\nconsequences.\n\n### Custom Data\n\nWhile the Event model fields may not be set on a user-defined model, custom data can\neasily be accommodated by extending the Event model and modifying the associated\ngetter / setter methods.\n\nFor example, let's assume your events server provides the `description` as \"desc\".\nThe response from the server would look like:\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1001,\n        \"calendarId\": 1,\n        \"startDate\": \"2016-09-30T21:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"endDate\": \"2016-09-30T22:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"title\": \"Demo starter app\",\n        \"desc\": \"Demonstrate the starter app to project management\"\n    }]\n\nInternally what is used to read and write the description is `{@link #method!getDescription getDescription}` and\n`{@link #method!setDescription setDescription}`.  By default those will be looking for the description string to be\non the `description` field.  To have our model work with the `desc` data instead the\nderived model would look like:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.model.Event', {\n        extend: 'Ext.calendar.model.Event',\n\n        getDescription: function () {\n            return this.data.desc;\n        },\n        setDescription: function (description) {\n            this.set('desc', description);\n        }\n    });\n\nThe model can then be specified on the Events store config:\n\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'calendar',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        height: 400,\n        width: 600,\n        store: {\n            autoLoad: true,\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'ajax',\n                url: 'calendars.php'\n            },\n            eventStoreDefaults: {\n                model: 'MyApp.model.Event',\n                proxy: {\n                    type: 'ajax',\n                    url: 'events.php'\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nThe calendar makes no assumptions about the structure of the data provided, only that\nit exists. This abstraction of data access ensures flexibility for a wide range of\ndata structures to be used.\n\nAs an example of this concept, the default Event model has a `startDate` and `endDate`\nfield. The {@link #method-getDuration} method is calculated based on these values.\nAnother possible implementation could be to have a `startDate` and `duration` field on\nthe model and have the `{@link #method!getEndDate getEndDate}` be a calculated quantity. The API makes no\ndistinction here, as long as the EventBase interface is fulfilled.\n",

A target date can be specified\nby setting the {@link #value} config option.\n\n### Sample View\n\nBelow is a sample view instance.  The following example shows how to create a day view,\nbut the basic configuration applies to all view subclasses with the exception of the\nxtype used.\n\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'calendar-day',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        height: 400,\n        width: 400,\n        store: {\n            autoLoad: true,\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'ajax',\n                url: 'calendars.php'\n            },\n            eventStoreDefaults: {\n                proxy: {\n                    type: 'ajax',\n                    url: 'events.php'\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nConfigurations for the view can be specified directly on the panel:\n\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'calendar-day',\n        height: 500,\n        height: 500,\n        resizeEvents: false,\n        startTime: 8,\n        endTime: 16,\n        store: {\n            autoLoad: true,\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'ajax',\n                url: 'calendars.php'\n            },\n            eventStoreDefaults: {\n                proxy: {\n                    type: 'ajax',\n                    url: 'events.php'\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        listeners: {\n            eventdrop: function() {\n                console.log('Dropped');\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n**Note:** For more information on possible store configurations and the expected\nserver response for both Calendars and Events stores see:\n{@link Ext.calendar.store.Calendars}.\n\n### In-View Calendar Events\n\nEvents show on the view timeline with their start and end times correlating to either\nthe date or the time slots depending on the view type.  The events will display on the\ntimeline according to your local timezone offset from GMT (the expected format for\nstart / end times for events is UTC).  The timezone offset can be applied explicitly\nusing the {@link #timezoneOffset} config option.  If the view has multiple source\ncalendars, their events will attempt to share overlapping space within their\ncorresponding date / time slots.  Events will be displayed as a different color for\neach source calendar and their appearance will vary slightly depending on their\n{@link Ext.calendar.Event.html#mode mode}.  The overlapping behavior of events\ncompeting for the same time slot can be managed using the {@link #displayOverlap}\nconfig option.\n\n### Adding / Editing Events\n\nEvents may be added to the view by dragging / swiping across the timeline to create\nthe event endpoints.  Doing so shows the {@link Ext.calendar.form.Add add event form}\nwith the dates / times pre-populated from the drag selection.  The\n{@link #allowSelection} config can be set to false to prevent user from creating\nevents in this way.  Events added programmatically by calling the\n{@link #method-showAddForm} method to present the add input form.  Set the view's\n{@link #addForm} config to `null` to prevent events from being added to the\ncalendar.\n\nDouble clicking / tapping an event within the view shows the\n{@link Ext.calendar.form.Edit edit event form} allowing events to be edited by users.\nThe add form and edit form can be configured using the view's {@link #addForm} and\n{@link #editForm} configs.  For views with time displayed on the y axis of the\nview (Day, Days, and Week), existing events can be resized using the resize handle on\nthe event widget as well as dragged across the view.  The {@link #resizeEvents},\n{@link #draggable}, and {@link #droppable} configs may be used to manage event\ninteractions.\n\n### View Navigation\n\nThe calendar view does not create controls for navigating the view's date range,\nhowever the view can be navigated programmatically.  The view's target date can be set\nexplicitly using the {@link #method-setValue} method.  The\n{@link #method-movePrevious} and {@link #method-moveNext} methods may be called to\nmove the displayed date range forward or back.  And the {@link #method-navigate} lets\nyou move the date an arbitrary amount relative to the current date {@link #value}.\n\n### Compact Mode\nThe base view class has a {@link #compact} config.  This boolean configures\nwhether or not the view is in compact mode.  It’s expected that this will be used as a\nplatform config or a responsive config.  Setting compact mode by itself does not\nmodify how the view displays.  What it does do is apply the\n{@link #compactOptions} config over the top over the current configuration\noptions.  These `{@link #cfg!compactOptions compactOptions}` are what is used to specify what compactness means\nfor a particular view.  Check out the `{@link #cfg!compactOptions compactOptions}` for each calendar view type to\nsee its default `{@link #cfg!compactOptions compactOptions}`.\n",

It is composed of the\nother calendar types such as {@link Ext.calendar.panel.Month},\n{@link Ext.calendar.panel.Week}, and {@link Ext.calendar.panel.Day}.\n\nIt also provides extra UI features like a switcher button,\n{@link #cfg-titleBar title bar}, and navigation buttons.\n\nSample Calendar panel\n\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'calendar',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        height: 400,\n        width: 600,\n        store: {\n            autoLoad: true,\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'ajax',\n                url: 'calendars.php'\n            },\n            eventStoreDefaults: {\n                proxy: {\n                    type: 'ajax',\n                    url: 'events.php'\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nBy default, the Calendar panel contains a {@link Ext.calendar.panel.Day Day},\n{@link Ext.calendar.panel.Week Week}, and {@link Ext.calendar.panel.Month Month} view.\nConfigurations for these views may be passed in the {@link #cfg-views} config option.\nFor example, to display only a 5-day work week instead of the default 7-day week the\nfollowing `{@link #cfg!views views}` config would be used:\n\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'calendar',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        height: 400,\n        width: 600,\n        store: {\n            autoLoad: true,\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'ajax',\n                url: 'calendars.php'\n            },\n            eventStoreDefaults: {\n                proxy: {\n                    type: 'ajax',\n                    url: 'events.php'\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        views: {\n            week: {\n                visibleDays: 5,\n                firstDayOfWeek: 1\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nThe previous example will result in a Day, Week, and Month view in the Calendar panel\nwith the Week view displaying only 5 days.  Set a default view to `null` to prevent it\nfrom being included in the Calendar panel.\n\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'calendar',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        height: 400,\n        width: 600,\n        store: {\n            autoLoad: true,\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'ajax',\n                url: 'calendars.php'\n            },\n            eventStoreDefaults: {\n                proxy: {\n                    type: 'ajax',\n                    url: 'events.php'\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        views: {\n            month: null,  // now only the Week and Day calendars will be included\n            week: {\n                visibleDays: 5,\n                firstDayOfWeek: 1\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nSee the {@link #cfg-views} config for additional configuration options.\n\nThe default view is \"month\".

For a week view including an hourly timeline see\n{@link Ext.calendar.panel.Week}.\n\nThe weeks panel shows the week containing the current date (or the date set on the\n{@link #value} config) plus any additional weeks totaling the\n{@link #visibleWeeks}.  The number of days shown per week is set using\n{@link #visibleDays}.  Each week begins on the day set on the\n{@link #firstDayOfWeek}.\n\nBy default the first day is Sunday.

The Calendars store contains one or\nmore source calendars whose primary purpose is to own\n{@link Ext.calendar.Event Events} within the source calendar's\n{@link Ext.calendar.store.Events Events store}.\n\n### Dynamic Events Store Configuration\n\nBelow is a sample calendar configured to {@link #cfg-autoLoad} source calendars from\n\"calendars.php\":\n\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'calendar',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        height: 400,\n        width: 600,\n        store: {\n            autoLoad: true,\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'ajax',\n                url: 'calendars.php'\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nAs mentioned before, source calendars themselves own Events stores.  Loading the\nCalendars store and its source calendars will automatically fetch events for the\ncalendar view's date range.  However, by default the Events store belonging to each\nsource calendar is not configured with a {@link Ext.data.proxy.Server proxy} to fetch\nthe remote events.  Using the above example the expected data response for a single\nsource calendar would look something like:\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"Personal\",\n        \"eventStore\": {\n            \"proxy\": {\n                \"type\": \"ajax\",\n                \"url\": \"events.php\"\n            }\n        }\n    }]\n\nIn the above data response we see:\n\n - **id** - The unique id for this source calendar record in the Calendars store\n - **title** - The source calendar title (used when displayed in a\n{@link Ext.calendar.form.CalendarPicker CalendarPicker})\n - **eventStore** - The config options for the source calendar Events store\n\n**Note:** for more information on the data the Calendar model consumes refer to\n{@link Ext.calendar.model.Calendar}\n\n### Default Events Store Configuration\n\nPassing the `eventStore` config back with the calendar offers maximum flexibility as\nthe Events store config / url can be specified uniquely per source calendar.  However,\nif the events will all be served up from the same remote source it may be more\neffective to configure the Calendars store's {@link #cfg-eventStoreDefaults} with\ncommon defaults.  As an example:\n\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'calendar',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        height: 400,\n        width: 600,\n        store: {\n            autoLoad: true,\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'ajax',\n                url: 'calendars.php'\n            },\n            eventStoreDefaults: {\n                proxy: {\n                    type: 'ajax',\n                    url: 'events.php'\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nWith the above configuration a sample response from \"calendars.php\" including a single\nsource calendar would be:\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"Personal\"\n    }]\n\nUsing the above Calendars config every source calendar passed back from\n\"calendars.php\" will have its events store configured to fetch events from\n\"events.php\".  Read operations requesting events will pass up to the remote server:\n\n - **calendar** - The id of the source calendar\n - **startDate** - The start date / time of events for the current calendar view\n - **endDate** - The end date / time of events for the current calendar view\n\nYou can configure the param names sent using the Event model's\n{@link Ext.calendar.store.Events#cfg-calendarParam calendarParam},\n{@link Ext.calendar.store.Events#cfg-startParam startParam}, and\n{{@link Ext.calendar.store.Events#cfg-endParam endParam}} config options.\n\n**Note:** The date range requested will be somewhat larger than the current visible\ndate range in the calendar view as set in the Events store's\n{@link Ext.calendar.store.Events#cfg-prefetchMode prefetchMode} config option.\nCommonly this configuration can be left as its default.\n\n### Events Response\n\nBelow is a sample response from 'events.php' for a 1 hour event.\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1001,\n        \"calendarId\": 1,\n        \"startDate\": \"2016-09-30T21:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"endDate\": \"2016-09-30T22:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"title\": \"Watch cartoons\",\n        \"description\": \"Catch up with adventurers Finn and Jake\"\n    }]\n\nSample response from 'events.php' for an all day event on Sept. 30th 2016\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1001,\n        \"calendarId\": 1,\n        \"startDate\": \"2016-09-30T00:00:00.000Z\",\n        \"endDate\": \"2016-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n        \"allDay\": true,\n        \"title\": \"Netflix Binge\",\n        \"description\": \"Watch Luke Cage.  Maybe twice.\"\n    }]\n\nAn all day event should be indicated as `allDay`: true.  Its `startDate` will be the\n00:00:00 hour of the target date and have an `endDate` with a 00:00:00 time on the\nfollowing day.\n\nIn the event response we see:\n\n - **id** - The unique id for the calendar event record\n - **calendarId** - The id of the parent source calendar\n - **startDate** - The event's start date and time (in UTC format)\n - **endDate** - The event's end date and time (in UTC format)\n - **title** - The title to display for the event\n - **description** - The description to display for the event\n\n**Note:** for more information on the data the Events model consumes refer to\n{@link Ext.calendar.model.Event}\n\n### Multi-Calendar Support\n\nThe calendar views also accommodate multiple source calendars within the same view.\nThe response from the Calendars store (from 'calendars.php' using the above example)\nshould be an array of objects containing a unique \"id\" per source calendar along with\nunique \"title\"s.  The titles will display in a combo field in the add/edit event forms\nas a way to indicate what source calendar an event belongs to as well as in the\n{@link Ext.calendar.panel.Panel Calendar panel's}\n{@link Ext.calendar.List calendar list}.  The id will correlate to the \"calendarId\"\nkey in the event response.\n\nSample response from 'calendars.php' including two source calendars: \"Personal\" and\n\"Work\"\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"Personal\"\n    }, {\n        \"id\": 2,\n        \"title\": \"Work\"\n    }]\n\nA view with two source calendars will make two read request each time the view's date\nrange is rendered.  Expected in return is two separate responses containing events\nwith \"calendarId\" keys corresponding to the calendar that owns the events.  With a\ncalendar view with both \"Personal\" and \"Work\" source calendars two responses would be\nexpected: one like as seen above including a key of `\"calendarId\": 1` and one for the\nWork calendar as seen here.\n\n    [{\n        \"id\": 2001,\n        \"calendarId\": 2,\n        \"startDate\": \"2016-09-30T21:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"endDate\": \"2016-09-30T22:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"title\": \"Meet with Development\",\n        \"description\": \"Discuss the current cycle requirements\"\n    }]\n\n**Note:** The \"id\"s for all events must be unique within a calendar store across all\nevent stores.  Duplicate \"id\"s even across event stores may result in unintended\nconsequences.\n",

Calendar views display events for a date /\ntime range specified by the view subclasses:\n\n- {@link Ext.calendar.view.Day Day}\n- {@link Ext.calendar.view.Days Days}\n- {@link Ext.calendar.view.Week Week}\n- {@link Ext.calendar.view.Weeks Weeks}\n- {@link Ext.calendar.view.Month Month}\n- {@link Ext.calendar.view.Multi Multi}\n\nBy default, the view will display the current date along with any other dates surround\nthat date as specified by the particular view type.  A target date can be specified\nby setting the {@link #value} config option.\n\n### Sample View\n\nBelow is a sample view instance.  The following example shows how to create a day view,\nbut the basic configuration applies to all view subclasses with the exception of the\nxtype used.\n\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'calendar-dayview',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        height: 400,\n        width: 400,\n        store: {\n            autoLoad: true,\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'ajax',\n                url: 'calendars.php'\n            },\n            eventStoreDefaults: {\n                proxy: {\n                    type: 'ajax',\n                    url: 'events.php'\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n**Note:** For more information on possible store configurations and the expected\nserver response for both Calendars and Events stores see:\n{@link Ext.calendar.store.Calendars}.\n\n### In-View Calendar Events\n\nEvents show on the view timeline with their start and end times correlating to either\nthe date or the time slots depending on the view type.  The events will display on the\ntimeline according to your local timezone offset from GMT (the expected format for\nstart / end times for events is UTC).  The timezone offset can be applied explicitly\nusing the {@link #timezoneOffset} config option.  If the view has multiple source\ncalendars, their events will attempt to share overlapping space within their\ncorresponding date / time slots.  Events will be displayed as a different color for\neach source calendar and their appearance will vary slightly depending on their\n{@link Ext.calendar.Event.html#mode mode}.  The overlapping behavior of events\ncompeting for the same time slot can be managed using the {@link #displayOverlap}\nconfig option.\n\n### Adding / Editing Events\n\nEvents may be added to the view by dragging / swiping across the timeline to create\nthe event endpoints.  Doing so shows the {@link Ext.calendar.form.Add add event form}\nwith the dates / times pre-populated from the drag selection.  The\n{@link #allowSelection} config can be set to false to prevent user from creating\nevents in this way.  Events added programmatically by calling the\n{@link #method-showAddForm} method to present the add input form.  Set the view's\n{@link #addForm} config to `null` to prevent events from being added to the\ncalendar.\n\nDouble clicking / tapping an event within the view shows the\n{@link Ext.calendar.form.Edit edit event form} allowing events to be edited by users.\nThe add form and edit form can be configured using the view's {@link #addForm} and\n{@link #editForm} configs.  For views with time displayed on the y axis of the\nview (Day, Days, and Week), existing events can be resized using the resize handle on\nthe event widget as well as dragged across the view.  The {@link #resizeEvents},\n{@link #draggable}, and {@link #droppable} configs may be used to manage event\ninteractions.\n\n### View Navigation\n\nThe calendar view does not create controls for navigating the view's date range,\nhowever the view can be navigated programmatically.  The view's target date can be set\nexplicitly using the {@link #method-setValue} method.  The\n{@link #method-movePrevious} and {@link #method-moveNext} methods may be called to\nmove the displayed date range forward or back.  And the {@link #method-navigate} lets\nyou move the date an arbitrary amount relative to the current date {@link #value}.\n\n### Compact Mode\nThe base view class has a {@link #compact} config.  This boolean configures\nwhether or not the view is in compact mode.  It’s expected that this will be used as a\nplatform config or a responsive config.  Setting compact mode by itself does not\nmodify how the view displays.  What it does do is apply the\n{@link #compactOptions} config over the top over the current configuration\noptions.  These `{@link #cfg!compactOptions compactOptions}` are what is used to specify what compactness means\nfor a particular view.  Check out the `{@link #cfg!compactOptions compactOptions}` for each calendar view type to\nsee its default `{@link #cfg!compactOptions compactOptions}`.\n",

A chart configuration object has some overall styling\noptions as well as an array of axes and series. A chart instance example could\nlook like this:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.chart.CartesianChart', {\n        width: 800,\n        height: 600,\n        animation: {\n            easing: 'backOut',\n            duration: 500\n        },\n        store: store1,\n        legend: {\n            position: 'right'\n        },\n        axes: [\n            // ...some axes options...\n        ],\n        series: [\n            // ...some series options...\n        ]\n    });\n\nIn this example we set the `{@link #cfg!width width}` and `{@link #cfg!height height}` of a chart; We decide whether\nour series are animated or not and we select a store to be bound to the chart;\nWe also set the legend to the right part of the chart.\n\nYou can register certain interactions such as {@link Ext.chart.interactions.PanZoom}\non the chart by specifying an array of names or more specific config objects.\nAll the events will be wired automatically.\n\nYou can also listen to series `itemXXX` events on both chart and series level.\n\nFor example:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.chart.CartesianChart', {\n        plugins: {\n            chartitemevents: {\n                moveEvents: true\n            }\n        },\n        store: {\n            fields: ['pet', 'households', 'total'],\n            data: [\n                {pet: 'Cats', households: 38, total: 93},\n                {pet: 'Dogs', households: 45, total: 79},\n                {pet: 'Fish', households: 13, total: 171}\n            ]\n        },\n        axes: [{\n            type: 'numeric',\n            position: 'left'\n        }, {\n            type: 'category',\n            position: 'bottom'\n        }],\n        series: [{\n            type: 'bar',\n            xField: 'pet',\n            yField: 'households',\n            listeners: {\n                itemmousemove: function (series, item, event) {\n                    console.log('itemmousemove', item.category, item.field);\n                }\n            }\n        }, {\n            type: 'line',\n            xField: 'pet',\n            yField: 'total',\n            marker: true\n        }],\n        listeners: { // Listen to itemclick events on all series.\n            itemclick: function (chart, item, event) {\n                console.log('itemclick', item.category, item.field);\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nImportant! It's generally a poor design choice to put interactive charts\ninside scrollable views, in such cases it's not possible to tell\nwhich component should respond to the interaction.\nSince charts are typically interactive their default touch action config\nlooks as follows: {@link Ext.draw.Container#touchAction}.\nIf you do have a chart inside a scrollable view, even if it has no interactions,\nyou have to set its `{@link #cfg!touchAction touchAction}` config to the following:\n\n    touchAction: {\n        panX: true,\n        panY: true\n    }\n\nOtherwise, if a touch action started on a chart, a swipe will not scroll\nthe view.\n\nFor more information about the axes and series configurations please check\nthe documentation of each series (Line, Bar, Pie, etc).\n",

        "doc": "\nDefines axis for charts.\n\nUsing the current model, the type of axis can be easily extended. By default, Sencha Charts provide three different\ntypes of axis:\n\n * **numeric** - the data attached to this axis is numeric and continuous.\n * **time** - the data attached to this axis is (or gets converted into) a date/time value; it is continuous.\n * **category** - the data attached to this axis belongs to a finite set. The data points are evenly placed along the axis.\n\nThe behavior of an axis can be easily changed by setting different types of axis layout and axis segmenter to the axis.\n\nAxis layout defines how the data points are placed. Using continuous layout, the data points will be distributed by\nthe numeric value. Using discrete layout the data points will be spaced evenly. Furthermore, if you want to combine\nthe data points with the duplicate values in a discrete layout, you should use combineDuplicate layout.\n\nSegmenter defines the way to segment data range. For example, if you have a Date-type data range from Jan 1, 1997 to\nJan 1, 2017, the segmenter will segement the data range into years, months or days based on the current zooming\nlevel.\n\nIt is possible to write custom axis layouts and segmenters to extends this behavior by simply implementing interfaces\n{@link Ext.chart.axis.layout.Layout} and {@link Ext.chart.axis.segmenter.Segmenter}.\n\nHere's an example for the axes part of a chart definition:\nAn example of axis for a series (in this case for an area chart that has multiple layers of yFields) could be:\n\n    axes: [{\n        type: 'numeric',\n        position: 'left',\n        title: 'Number of Hits',\n        grid: {\n            odd: {\n                opacity: 1,\n                fill: '#ddd',\n                stroke: '#bbb',\n                lineWidth: 1\n            }\n        },\n        minimum: 0\n    }, {\n        type: 'category',\n        position: 'bottom',\n        title: 'Month of the Year',\n        grid: true,\n        label: {\n            rotate: {\n                degrees: 315\n            }\n        }\n    }]\n\nIn this case we use a `numeric` axis for displaying the values of the Area series and a `category` axis for displaying the names of\nthe store elements. The numeric axis is placed on the left of the screen, while the category axis is placed at the bottom of the chart.\nBoth the category and numeric axes have `{@link #cfg!grid grid}` set, which means that horizontal and vertical lines will cover the chart background. In the\ncategory axis the labels will be rotated so they can fit the space better.\n",

However, it's now\npublicly accessible without sacrificing encapsulation, via setter and getter methods.\n\n    var jacky = new My.sample.Person({\n        name: \"Jacky\",\n        age: 35\n    });\n\n    alert(jacky.getAge());      // alerts 35\n    alert(jacky.getGender());   // alerts \"Male\"\n\n    jacky.setName(\"Mr. Nguyen\");\n    alert(jacky.getName());     // alerts \"Mr. Nguyen\"\n\nNotice that we changed the class constructor to invoke this.initConfig() and pass in the\nprovided config object. Two key things happened:\n\n - The provided config object when the class is instantiated is recursively merged with\nthe default config object.\n - All corresponding setter methods are called with the merged values.\n\nBeside storing the given values, throughout the frameworks, setters generally have two key\nresponsibilities:\n\n - Filtering / validation / transformation of the given value before it's actually stored\nwithin the instance.\n - Notification (such as firing events) / post-processing after the value has been set,\nor changed from a previous value.\n\nBy standardize this common pattern, the default generated setters provide two extra template\nmethods that you can put your own custom logic into, i.e: an \"applyFoo\" and \"updateFoo\"\nmethod for a \"foo\" config item, which are executed before and after the value is actually\nset, respectively. Back to the example class, let's validate that age must be a valid\npositive number, and fire an 'agechange' if the value is modified.\n\n    Ext.define('My.sample.Person', {\n        config: {\n            // ...\n        },\n\n        constructor: {\n            // ...\n        },\n\n        applyAge: function(age) {\n            if (typeof age !== 'number' || age < 0) {\n                console.warn(\"Invalid age, must be a positive number\");\n                return;\n            }\n\n            return age;\n        },\n\n        updateAge: function(newAge, oldAge) {\n            // age has changed from \"oldAge\" to \"newAge\"\n            this.fireEvent('agechange', this, newAge, oldAge);\n        }\n\n        // ...\n    });\n\n    var jacky = new My.sample.Person({\n        name: \"Jacky\",\n        age: 'invalid'\n    });\n\n    alert(jacky.getAge());      // alerts 0\n\n    alert(jacky.setAge(-100));  // alerts 0\n    alert(jacky.getAge());      // alerts 0\n\n    alert(jacky.setAge(35));    // alerts 0\n    alert(jacky.getAge());      // alerts 35\n\nIn other words, when leveraging the config feature, you mostly never need to define setter\nand getter methods explicitly. Instead, \"apply*\" and \"update*\" methods should be implemented\nwhere necessary. Your code will be consistent throughout and only contain the minimal logic\nthat you actually care about.\n\nWhen it comes to inheritance, the default config of the parent class is automatically,\nrecursively merged with the child's default config. The same applies for mixins.\n"

The call to the setter can be\nhalted by returning `false` from a listener on the **before** event.\n\n    var test = Ext.create('MyApp.util.Test', {\n        listeners: {\n            beforefoochange: function (instance, newValue, oldValue) {\n                return newValue !== 'bar';\n            },\n            foochange: function (instance, newValue, oldValue) {\n               console.log('foo changed to:', newValue);\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    test.setFoo('bar');\n\nThe `before` event handler can be used to validate changes to `foo`.\nReturning `false` will prevent the setter from changing the value of the\nconfig.  In the previous example the `beforefoochange` handler returns false\nso `foo` will not be updated and `foochange` will not be fired.\n\n    test.setFoo('baz');\n\nSetting `foo` to 'baz' will not be prevented by the `before` handler.  Foo\nwill be set to the value: 'baz' and the `foochange` event will be fired.\n"

Using `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}` is the most common way to define component instances,\nespecially in a container. For example, the items in a form containing text fields\ncould be created explicitly like so:\n\n     items: [\n         Ext.create('Ext.form.field.Text', {\n             fieldLabel: 'Foo'\n         }),\n         Ext.create('Ext.form.field.Text', {\n             fieldLabel: 'Bar'\n         }),\n         Ext.create('Ext.form.field.Number', {\n             fieldLabel: 'Num'\n         })\n     ]\n\nBut by using `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}`, the above becomes:\n\n     items: [\n         {\n             xtype: 'textfield',\n             fieldLabel: 'Foo'\n         },\n         {\n             xtype: 'textfield',\n             fieldLabel: 'Bar'\n         },\n         {\n             xtype: 'numberfield',\n             fieldLabel: 'Num'\n         }\n     ]\n\nWhen the `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}` is common to many items, {@link Ext.container.Container#defaultType}\nis another way to specify the `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}` for all items that don't have an explicit `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}`:\n\n     defaultType: 'textfield',\n     items: [\n         { fieldLabel: 'Foo' },\n         { fieldLabel: 'Bar' },\n         { fieldLabel: 'Num', xtype: 'numberfield' }\n     ]\n\nEach member of the `items` array is now just a \"configuration object\". These objects\nare used to create and configure component instances. A configuration object can be\nmanually used to instantiate a component using {@link Ext#widget}:\n\n     var text1 = Ext.create('Ext.form.field.Text', {\n         fieldLabel: 'Foo'\n     });\n\n     // or alternatively:\n\n     var text1 = Ext.widget({\n         xtype: 'textfield',\n         fieldLabel: 'Foo'\n     });\n\nThis conversion of configuration objects into instantiated components is done when\na container is created as part of its {Ext.container.AbstractContainer#initComponent}\nprocess. As part of the same process, the `items` array is converted from its raw\narray form into a {@link Ext.util.MixedCollection} instance.\n\nYou can define your own `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}` on a custom {@link Ext.Component component} by specifying\nthe `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}` property in {@link Ext#define}. For example:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.PressMeButton', {\n        extend: 'Ext.button.Button',\n        xtype: 'pressmebutton',\n        text: 'Press Me'\n    });\n\nCare should be taken when naming an `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}` in a custom component because there is\na single, shared scope for all xtypes. Third part components should consider using\na prefix to avoid collisions.\n\n    Ext.define('Foo.form.CoolButton', {\n        extend: 'Ext.button.Button',\n        xtype: 'ux-coolbutton',\n        text: 'Cool!'\n    });\n\nSee {@link Ext.enums.Widget} for list of all available xtypes.\n"

These indicate\na version number where methods or properties were deprecated. These versions are\ncompared to the version reported by `Ext.getCompatVersion` to determine the action\nto take for each \"block\".\n\nWhen the compatibility version is set to a value less than a version number key,\nthat block is said to be \"enabled\". For example, if a method was deprecated in\nversion 5.0 but the desired compatibility level is 4.2 then the block is used to\npatch methods and (to some degree) restore pre-5.0 compatibility.\n\nWhen multiple active blocks have the same method name, each method is applied as\nan override in reverse order of version. In the above example, if a method appears\nin the \"5.0\", \"5.1\" and \"5.2\" blocks then the \"5.2\" method is applied as an override\nfirst, followed by the \"5.1\" method and finally the \"5.0\" method. This means that\nthe `callParent` from the \"5.0\" method calls the \"5.1\" method which calls the\n\"5.2\" method which can (if applicable) call the current version.\n"

        "doc": "Base class for all Ext components.\n\nThe Component base class has built-in support for basic hide/show and enable/disable\nand size control behavior.\n\n## xtypes\n\nEvery component has a specific xtype, which is its Ext-specific type name, along with\nmethods for checking the xtype like {@link #getXType} and {@link #isXType}. See the\n[Component Guide](../guides/core_concepts/components.html) for more information on xtypes\nand the Component hierarchy.\n\n## Finding components\n\nAll Components are registered with the {@link Ext.ComponentManager} on construction so\nthat they can be referenced at any time via {@link Ext#getCmp Ext.getCmp}, passing the\n{@link #id}.\n\nAdditionally the {@link Ext.ComponentQuery} provides a CSS-selectors-like way to look\nup components by their xtype and many other attributes.  For example the following code\nwill find all textfield components inside component with `id: 'myform'`:\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('#myform textfield');\n\n## Extending Ext.Component\n\nAll subclasses of Component may participate in the automated Ext component\nlife cycle of creation, rendering and destruction which is provided by the\n{@link Ext.container.Container Container} class. Components may be added to a Container\nthrough the {@link Ext.container.Container#cfg-items items} config option at the time\nthe Container is created, or they may be added dynamically via the\n{@link Ext.container.Container#method-add add} method.\n\nAll user-developed visual widgets that are required to participate in automated\nlife cycle and size management should subclass Component.\n\nSee the Creating new UI controls chapter in\n[Component Guide](../guides/core_concepts/components.html) for details on how and to either\nextend or augment Ext JS base classes to create custom Components.\n\n## The Ext.Component class by itself\n\nUsually one doesn't need to instantiate the Ext.Component class. There are subclasses\nwhich implement specialized use cases, covering most application needs. However it is\npossible to instantiate a base Component, and it can be rendered to document, or handled\nby layouts as the child item of a Container:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.Component', {\n        html: 'Hello world!',\n        width: 300,\n        height: 200,\n        padding: 20,\n        style: {\n            color: '#FFFFFF',\n            backgroundColor:'#000000'\n        },\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\nThe Component above creates its encapsulating `div` upon render, and use the configured\nHTML as content. More complex internal structure may be created using the\n{@link #renderTpl} configuration, although to display database-derived mass data, it is\nrecommended that an ExtJS data-backed Component such as a {@link Ext.view.View View},\n{@link Ext.grid.Panel GridPanel}, or {@link Ext.tree.Panel TreePanel} be used.\n",

The following types of anchor values are supported:\n\n- **Percentage** : Any value between 1 and 100, expressed as a percentage.\n\n  The first anchor is the percentage width that the item should take up within the container,\n  and the second is the percentage height.  For example:\n\n      // two values specified\n      anchor: '100% 50%' // render item complete width of the container and\n                         // 1/2 height of the container\n      // one value specified\n      anchor: '100%'     // the width value; the height will default to auto\n\n- **Offsets** : Any positive or negative integer value.\n\n  This is a raw adjustment where the first anchor is the offset from the right edge\n  of the container, and the second is the offset from the bottom edge. For example:\n\n      // two values specified\n      anchor: '-50 -100' // render item the complete width of the container\n                         // minus 50 pixels and\n                         // the complete height minus 100 pixels.\n      // one value specified\n      anchor: '-50'      // anchor value is assumed to be the right offset value\n                         // bottom offset will default to 0\n\n- **Sides** : Valid values are `right` (or `r`) and `bottom` (or `b`).\n\n  Either the container must have a fixed size or an anchorSize config value defined\n  at render time in order for these to have any effect.\n\n- **Mixed** :\n\n  Anchor values can also be mixed as needed.  For example, to render the width offset\n  from the container right edge by 50 pixels and 75% of the container's height use:\n\n      anchor:   '-50 75%'\n"

For example, the items in a form containing text fields\ncould be created explicitly like so:\n\n     items: [\n         Ext.create('Ext.form.field.Text', {\n             fieldLabel: 'Foo'\n         }),\n         Ext.create('Ext.form.field.Text', {\n             fieldLabel: 'Bar'\n         }),\n         Ext.create('Ext.form.field.Number', {\n             fieldLabel: 'Num'\n         })\n     ]\n\nBut by using `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}`, the above becomes:\n\n     items: [\n         {\n             xtype: 'textfield',\n             fieldLabel: 'Foo'\n         },\n         {\n             xtype: 'textfield',\n             fieldLabel: 'Bar'\n         },\n         {\n             xtype: 'numberfield',\n             fieldLabel: 'Num'\n         }\n     ]\n\nWhen the `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}` is common to many items, {@link Ext.container.Container#defaultType}\nis another way to specify the `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}` for all items that don't have an explicit `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}`:\n\n     defaultType: 'textfield',\n     items: [\n         { fieldLabel: 'Foo' },\n         { fieldLabel: 'Bar' },\n         { fieldLabel: 'Num', xtype: 'numberfield' }\n     ]\n\nEach member of the `items` array is now just a \"configuration object\". These objects\nare used to create and configure component instances. A configuration object can be\nmanually used to instantiate a component using {@link Ext#widget}:\n\n     var text1 = Ext.create('Ext.form.field.Text', {\n         fieldLabel: 'Foo'\n     });\n\n     // or alternatively:\n\n     var text1 = Ext.widget({\n         xtype: 'textfield',\n         fieldLabel: 'Foo'\n     });\n\nThis conversion of configuration objects into instantiated components is done when\na container is created as part of its {Ext.container.AbstractContainer#initComponent}\nprocess. As part of the same process, the `items` array is converted from its raw\narray form into a {@link Ext.util.MixedCollection} instance.\n\nYou can define your own `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}` on a custom {@link Ext.Component component} by specifying\nthe `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}` property in {@link Ext#define}. For example:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.PressMeButton', {\n        extend: 'Ext.button.Button',\n        xtype: 'pressmebutton',\n        text: 'Press Me'\n    });\n\nCare should be taken when naming an `{@link #cfg!xtype xtype}` in a custom component because there is\na single, shared scope for all xtypes. Third part components should consider using\na prefix to avoid collisions.\n\n    Ext.define('Foo.form.CoolButton', {\n        extend: 'Ext.button.Button',\n        xtype: 'ux-coolbutton',\n        text: 'Cool!'\n    });\n\nSee {@link Ext.enums.Widget} for list of all available xtypes.\n"

There are several\nrelationship operators, mostly taken from CSS selectors:\n\n- **`E F`** All descendant Components of E that match F\n- **`E > F`** All direct children Components of E that match F\n- **`E ^ F`** All parent Components of E that match F\n\nExpressions between relationship operators are matched left to right, i.e. leftmost\nselector is applied first, then if one or more matches are found, relationship operator\nitself is applied, then next selector expression, etc. It is possible to combine\nrelationship operators in complex selectors:\n\n    window[title=\"Input form\"] textfield[name=login] ^ form > button[action=submit]\n\nThat selector can be read this way: Find a window with title \"Input form\", in that\nwindow find a TextField with name \"login\" at any depth (including subpanels and/or\nFieldSets), then find an `{@link Ext.form.Panel}` that is a parent of the TextField, and in\nthat form find a direct child that is a button with custom property `action` set to\nvalue \"submit\".\n\nWhitespace on both sides of `^` and `>` operators is non-significant, i.e. can be\nomitted, but usually is used for clarity.\n\n## Searching by Component attributes\n\nComponents can be searched by their object property values (attributes). To do that,\nuse attribute matching expression in square brackets:\n\n- `component[disabled]` - matches any Component that has `disabled` property with\nany truthy (non-empty, not `false`) value.\n- `panel[title=\"Test\"]` - matches any Component that has `title` property set to\n\"Test\". Note that if the value does not contain spaces, the quotes are optional.\n\nAttributes can use any of the following operators to compare values:\n`=`, `!=`, `^=`, `$=`, `*=`, `%=`, `|=` and `~=`.\n\nPrefixing the attribute name with an at sign `@` means that the property must be\nthe object's `ownProperty`, not a property from the prototype chain.\n\nSpecifications like `[propName]` check that the property is a truthy value. To check\nthat the object has an `ownProperty` of a certain name, regardless of the value use\nthe form `[?propName]`.\n\nThe specified value is coerced to match the type of the property found in the\ncandidate Component using {@link Ext#coerce}.\n\nIf you need to find Components by their `itemId` property, use the `#id` form; it will\ndo the same as `[itemId=id]` but is easier to read.\n\nIf you need to include a metacharacter like (, ), [, ], etc., in the query, escape it\nby prefixing it with a backslash:\n\n     var component = Ext.ComponentQuery.query('[myProperty=\\\\[foo\\\\]]');\n\n## Attribute matching operators\n\nThe '=' operator will return the results that **exactly** match the\nspecified object property (attribute):\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel[cls=my-cls]');\n\nWill match the following Component:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.window.Window', {\n        cls: 'my-cls'\n    });\n\nBut will not match the following Component, because 'my-cls' is one value\namong others:\n\n     Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', {\n         cls: 'foo-cls my-cls bar-cls'\n     });\n\nYou can use the '~=' operator instead, it will return Components with\nthe property that **exactly** matches one of the whitespace-separated\nvalues. This is also true for properties that only have *one* value:\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel[cls~=my-cls]');\n\nWill match both Components:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', {\n        cls: 'foo-cls my-cls bar-cls'\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.window.Window', {\n        cls: 'my-cls'\n    });\n\nGenerally, '=' operator is more suited for object properties other than\nCSS classes, while '~=' operator will work best with properties that\nhold lists of whitespace-separated CSS classes.\n\nThe '^=' operator will return Components with specified attribute that\nstart with the passed value:\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel[title^=Sales]');\n\nWill match the following Component:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', {\n        title: 'Sales estimate for Q4'\n    });\n\nThe '$=' operator will return Components with specified properties that\nend with the passed value:\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('field[fieldLabel$=name]');\n\nWill match the following Component:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.field.Text', {\n        fieldLabel: 'Enter your name'\n    });\n\nThe '/=' operator will return Components with specified properties that\nmatch the passed regular expression:\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('button[action/=\"edit|save\"]');\n\nWill match the following Components with a custom `action` property:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.button.Button', {\n         action: 'edit'\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.button.Button', {\n         action: 'save'\n    });\n\nWhen you need to use meta characters like [], (), etc. in your query, make sure\nto escape them with back slashes:\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel[title=\"^Sales for Q\\\\[1-4\\\\]\"]');\n\nThe following test will find panels with their `ownProperty` collapsed being equal to\n`false`. It will **not** match a collapsed property from the prototype chain.\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel[@collapsed=false]');\n\nMember expressions from candidate Components may be tested. If the expression returns\na *truthy* value, the candidate Component will be included in the query:\n\n    var disabledFields = myFormPanel.query(\"{isDisabled()}\");\n\nSuch expressions are executed in Component's context, and the above expression is\nsimilar to running this snippet for every Component in your application:\n\n     if (component.isDisabled()) {\n         matches.push(component);\n     }\n\nIt is important to use only methods that are available in **every** Component instance\nto avoid run time exceptions. If you need to match your Components with a custom\ncondition formula, you can augment `{@link Ext.Component}` to provide custom matcher that\nwill return `false` by default, and override it in your custom classes:\n\n     Ext.define('My.Component', {\n         override: 'Ext.Component',\n         myMatcher: function() { return false; }\n     });\n\n     Ext.define('My.Panel', {\n         extend: 'Ext.panel.Panel',\n         requires: ['My.Component'],     // Ensure that Component override is applied\n         myMatcher: function(selector) {\n             return selector === 'myPanel';\n         }\n     });\n\nAfter that you can use a selector with your custom matcher to find all instances\nof `My.Panel`:\n\n     Ext.ComponentQuery.query(\"{myMatcher('myPanel')}\");\n\nHowever if you really need to use a custom matcher, you may find it easier to implement\na custom Pseudo class instead (see below).\n\n## Conditional matching\n\nAttribute matchers can be combined to select only Components that match **all**\nconditions (logical AND operator):\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel[cls~=my-cls][floating=true][title$=\"sales data\"]');\n\nE.g., the query above will match only a Panel-descended Component that has 'my-cls'\nCSS class *and* is floating *and* with a title that ends with \"sales data\".\n\nExpressions separated with commas will match any Component that satisfies\n*either* expression (logical OR operator):\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('field[fieldLabel^=User], field[fieldLabel*=password]');\n\nE.g., the query above will match any field with field label starting with \"User\",\n*or* any field that has \"password\" in its label.\n\nIf you need to include a comma in an attribute matching expression, escape it with a\nbackslash:\n\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('field[fieldLabel^=\"User\\\\, foo\"], field[fieldLabel*=password]');\n\n## Pseudo classes\n\nPseudo classes may be used to filter results in the same way as in\n{@link Ext.dom.Query}. There are five default pseudo classes:\n\n* `not` Negates a selector.\n* `first` Filters out all except the first matching item for a selector.\n* `last` Filters out all except the last matching item for a selector.\n* `focusable` Filters out all except Components which by definition and configuration are\n     potentially able to receieve focus, and can be focused at this time. Component can be\n     focused when it is rendered, visible, and not disabled. Some Components can be focusable\n     even when disabled (e.g. Menu items) via their parent Container configuration.\n     Containers such as Panels generally are not focusable by themselves but can use\n     focus delegation (`defaultFocus` config). Some Containers such as Menus and Windows\n     are focusable by default.\n* `canfocus` Filters out all except Components which are curently able to receieve focus.\n     That is, they are defined and configured focusable, and they are also visible and enabled.\n     Note that this selector intentionally bypasses some checks done by `focusable` selector\n     and works in a subtly different way. It is used internally by the framework and is not\n     a replacement for `:focusable` selector.\n* `nth-child` Filters Components by ordinal position in the selection.\n* `scrollable` Filters out all except Components which are scrollable.\n* `visible` Filters out hidden Components. May test deep visibility using `':visible(true)'`\n\nThese pseudo classes can be used with other matchers or without them:\n\n     // Select first direct child button in any panel\n     Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel > button:first');\n\n     // Select last field in Profile form\n     Ext.ComponentQuery.query('form[title=Profile] field:last');\n\n     // Find first focusable Component in a panel and focus it\n     panel.down(':canfocus').focus();\n\n     // Select any field that is not hidden in a form\n     form.query('field:not(hiddenfield)');\n\n     // Find last scrollable Component and reset its scroll positions.\n     tabpanel.down(':scrollable[hideMode=display]:last').getScrollable().scrollTo(0, 0);\n\nPseudo class `nth-child` can be used to find any child Component by its\nposition relative to its siblings. This class' handler takes one argument\nthat specifies the selection formula as `Xn` or `Xn+Y`:\n\n     // Find every odd field in a form\n     form.query('field:nth-child(2n+1)'); // or use shortcut: :nth-child(odd)\n\n     // Find every even field in a form\n     form.query('field:nth-child(2n)');   // or use shortcut: :nth-child(even)\n\n     // Find every 3rd field in a form\n     form.query('field:nth-child(3n)');\n\n**Note:** The `nth-child` selector returns 1-based result sets.\n\nPseudo classes can be combined to further filter the results, e.g., in the\nform example above we can modify the query to exclude hidden fields:\n\n     // Find every 3rd non-hidden field in a form\n     form.query('field:not(hiddenfield):nth-child(3n)');\n\nNote that when combining pseudo classes, whitespace is significant, i.e.\nthere should be no spaces between pseudo classes. This is a common mistake;\nif you accidentally type a space between `field` and `:not`, the query\nwill not return any result because it will mean \"find *field's children\nComponents* that are not hidden fields...\".\n\n## Custom pseudo classes\n\nIt is possible to define your own custom pseudo classes. In fact, a\npseudo class is just a property in `Ext.ComponentQuery.pseudos` object\nthat defines pseudo class name (property name) and pseudo class handler\n(property value):\n\n    // Function receives array and returns a filtered array.\n    Ext.ComponentQuery.pseudos.invalid = function(items) {\n        var i = 0, l = items.length, c, result = [];\n        for (; i < l; i++) {\n            if (!(c = items[i]).isValid()) {\n                result.push(c);\n            }\n        }\n        return result;\n    };\n\n    var invalidFields = myFormPanel.query('field:invalid');\n    if (invalidFields.length) {\n        invalidFields[0].getEl().scrollIntoView(myFormPanel.body);\n        for (var i = 0, l = invalidFields.length; i < l; i++) {\n            invalidFields[i].getEl().frame(\"red\");\n        }\n    }\n\nPseudo class handlers can be even more flexible, with a selector\nargument used to define the logic:\n\n     // Handler receives array of itmes and selector in parentheses\n     Ext.ComponentQuery.pseudos.titleRegex = function(components, selector) {\n         var i = 0, l = components.length, c, result = [], regex = new RegExp(selector);\n         for (; i < l; i++) {\n             c = components[i];\n             if (c.title && regex.test(c.title)) {\n                 result.push(c);\n             }\n         }\n         return result;\n     }\n\n     var salesTabs = tabPanel.query('panel:titleRegex(\"sales\\\\s+for\\\\s+201[123]\")');\n\nBe careful when using custom pseudo classes with MVC Controllers: when\nyou use a pseudo class in Controller's `control` or `listen` component\nselectors, the pseudo class' handler function will be called very often\nand may slow down your application significantly. A good rule of thumb\nis to always specify Component xtype with the pseudo class so that the\nhandlers are only called on Components that you need, and try to make\nthe condition checks as cheap in terms of execution time as possible.\nNote how in the example above, handler function checks that Component\n*has* a title first, before running regex test on it.\n\n## Query examples\n\nQueries return an array of Components. Here are some example queries:\n\n    // retrieve all Ext.Panels in the document by xtype\n    var panelsArray = Ext.ComponentQuery.query('panel');\n\n    // retrieve all Ext.Panels within the container with an id myCt\n    var panelsWithinmyCt = Ext.ComponentQuery.query('#myCt panel');\n\n    // retrieve all direct children which are Ext.Panels within myCt\n    var directChildPanel = Ext.ComponentQuery.query('#myCt > panel');\n\n    // retrieve all grids or trees\n    var gridsAndTrees = Ext.ComponentQuery.query('gridpanel, treepanel');\n\n    // Focus first Component\n    myFormPanel.child(':canfocus').focus();\n\n    // Retrieve every odd text field in a form\n    myFormPanel.query('textfield:nth-child(odd)');\n\n    // Retrieve every even field in a form, excluding hidden fields\n    myFormPanel.query('field:not(hiddenfield):nth-child(even)');\n\n    // Retrieve every scrollable in a tabpanel\n    tabpanel.query(':scrollable');\n\nFor easy access to queries based from a particular Container see the\n{@link Ext.container.Container#query}, {@link Ext.container.Container#down} and\n{@link Ext.container.Container#child} methods.

        "type": "Ext.container.Container",
        "doc": "Base class for any Ext.Component that may contain other Components. Containers handle the basic\nbehavior of containing items, namely adding, inserting and removing items.\n\nThe most commonly used Container classes are Ext.panel.Panel, Ext.window.Window and\nExt.tab.Panel. If you do not need the capabilities offered by the aforementioned classes you can\ncreate a lightweight Container to be encapsulated by an HTML element to your specifications\nby using the {@link Ext.Component#autoEl autoEl} config option.\n\nThe code below illustrates how to explicitly create a Container:\n\n    @example\n    // Explicitly create a Container\n    Ext.create('Ext.container.Container', {\n        layout: {\n            type: 'hbox'\n        },\n        width: 400,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        border: 1,\n        style: {borderColor:'#000000', borderStyle:'solid', borderWidth:'1px'},\n        defaults: {\n            labelWidth: 80,\n            // implicitly create Container by specifying xtype\n            xtype: 'datefield',\n            flex: 1,\n            style: {\n                padding: '10px'\n            }\n        },\n        items: [{\n            xtype: 'datefield',\n            name: 'startDate',\n            fieldLabel: 'Start date'\n        },{\n            xtype: 'datefield',\n            name: 'endDate',\n            fieldLabel: 'End date'\n        }]\n    });\n\n## Layout\n\nContainer classes delegate the rendering of child Components to a layout manager class which must\nbe configured into the Container using the `{@link #layout}` configuration property.\n\nWhen either specifying child `{@link #cfg-items}` of a Container, or dynamically\n{@link #method-add adding} Components to a Container, remember to consider how you wish\nthe Container to arrange those child elements, and whether those child elements need to be sized\nusing one of Ext's built-in `{@link #layout}` schemes. By default, Containers use the\n{@link Ext.layout.container.Auto Auto} scheme which only renders child components, appending them\none after the other inside the Container, and **does not apply any sizing** at all.\n\nA common mistake is when a developer neglects to specify a `{@link #layout}` (e.g. GridPanels or\nTreePanels are added to Containers for which no `{@link #layout}` has been specified).\nIf a Container is left to use the default {@link Ext.layout.container.Auto Auto} scheme,\nnone of its child components will be resized, or changed in any way when the Container\nis resized.\n\nCertain layout managers allow dynamic addition of child components. Those that do include\nExt.layout.container.Card, Ext.layout.container.Anchor, Ext.layout.container.VBox,\nExt.layout.container.HBox, and Ext.layout.container.Table. For example:\n\n    //  Create the GridPanel.\n    var myNewGrid = Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {\n        store: myStore,\n        headers: myHeaders,\n        title: 'Results', // the title becomes the title of the tab\n    });\n\n    myTabPanel.add(myNewGrid); // Ext.tab.Panel implicitly uses Ext.layout.container.Card\n    myTabPanel.setActiveTab(myNewGrid);\n\nThe example above adds a newly created GridPanel to a TabPanel. Note that a TabPanel uses\n{@link Ext.layout.container.Card} as its layout manager which means all its child items are sized\nto {@link Ext.layout.container.Fit fit} exactly into its client area.\n\n**_Overnesting is a common problem_**. An example of overnesting occurs when a GridPanel is added\nto a TabPanel by wrapping the GridPanel _inside_ a wrapping Panel (that has no `{@link #layout}`\nspecified) and then add that wrapping Panel to the TabPanel. The point to realize is that\na GridPanel **is** a Component which can be added directly to a Container. If the wrapping Panel\nhas no `{@link #layout}` configuration, then the overnested GridPanel will not be sized\nas expected.\n\n## {@link Ext.Component#reference References} and {@link #referenceHolder Reference Holders}\n\nReference holders are used to keep references to child components inside a hierarchy.\n\nThis functionality allows the connection of encapsulated references between containers\nand their child components declaratively. Simple usage:\n\n    Ext.define('Login', {\n        extend: 'Ext.window.Window',\n\n        // This config is not compatible with the more common \"controller\" config\n        // used to specify a ViewController for the view. When a ViewController is\n        // specified it effectively acts as the \"reference holder\" for the view.

This allows for declarative binding of events in a useful way:\n\n    Ext.define('MyView', {\n        extend: 'Ext.container.Container',\n        defaultListenerScope: true,\n        referenceHolder: true,\n        items: [{\n            xtype: 'textfield',\n            reference: 'myfield'\n        }, {\n            xtype: 'button',\n            text: 'Set to A',\n            listeners: {\n                click: 'onButtonAClick'\n            }\n        }, {\n            xtype: 'button',\n            text: 'Set to B',\n            listeners: {\n                click: 'onButtonBClick'\n            }\n        }],\n\n        onButtonAClick: function() {\n            this.lookupReference('myfield').setValue('A');\n        },\n\n        onButtonBClick: function() {\n            this.lookupReference('myfield').setValue('B');\n        }\n    });\n\nLike {@link #referenceHolder}, the {@link #defaultListenerScope} is encapsulated, the scope will\nbe resolved at the closest {@link #defaultListenerScope} above it in the component hierarchy:\n\n    var ct = new Ext.container.Container({\n        defaultListenerScope: true,\n        onCustomEvent: function() {\n            console.log('Outer called'); // Will NOT be called\n        },\n        items: [{\n            xtype: 'container',\n            defaultListenerScope: true,\n            onCustomEvent: function() {\n                console.log('Inner called'); // Will be called\n            },\n            items: [{\n                xtype: 'component',\n                itemId: 'child',\n                listeners: {\n                    customevent: 'onCustomEvent'\n                }\n            }]\n        }]\n    });\n    // The main container will not have references to a/b, each innerCt will\n    console.log(ct.lookupReference('a'), ct.lookupReference('b'));\n    var inner1 = ct.lookupReference('innerCt1');\n    var inner2 = ct.lookupReference('innerCt2');\n\n    console.log(inner1.lookupReference('a').id, inner1.lookupReference('b').id);\n    console.log(inner2.lookupReference('a').id, inner2.lookupReference('b').id);\n\nSimilar to references, if a {@link Ext.app.ViewController} is attached to this view, it becomes\nthe {@link #defaultListenerScope}, which means un-scoped, late bound events will be directed\nto the controller. This is powerful as it allows views to be totally declarative:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.controller.Login', {\n        extend : 'Ext.app.ViewController',\n        alias : 'controller.login',\n\n        init: function() {\n            this.sendCount = 0;\n        },\n\n        onLoginClick : function(btn) {\n            this.login();\n        },\n\n        onFieldSpecialKey : function(field, e) {\n            if (e.getKey() === e.ENTER) {\n               this.login();\n            }\n        },\n\n        login : function() {\n           var form = this.lookupReference('form');\n            this.lookupReference('error').hide();\n            if (form.isValid()) {\n                console.log('Do the login!');\n                // Server responded...\n                if (++this.sendCount % 2 === 0) {\n                    this.onServerSuccess();\n                } else {\n                    this.onServerFailure();\n                }\n            }\n        },\n\n        onServerSuccess: function() {\n            // Proceed\n            console.log('All good');\n        },\n\n        onServerFailure: function() {\n            var error = this.lookupReference('error');\n            error.update('Invalid username/password');\n            error.show();\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.view.Login', {\n        extend : 'Ext.window.Window',\n        controller : 'login',\n        referenceHolder: true,\n\n        title : 'Login',\n        width : 400,\n\n        items : [{\n            xtype : 'form',\n            reference : 'form',\n            border : false,\n            bodyPadding : 10,\n            defaultType : 'textfield',\n            defaults : {\n                anchor : '90%',\n                allowBlank : false,\n                enableKeyEvents : true\n            },\n            items : [{\n                xtype: 'component',\n                reference: 'error',\n                hidden: true,\n                margin: '0 0 10 0',\n                style: 'color: red;'\n            }, {\n                name : 'username',\n                fieldLabel : 'Username',\n                reference : 'username',\n                listeners : {\n                    specialkey : 'onFieldSpecialKey'\n                }\n            }, {\n                name : 'password',\n                fieldLabel : 'Password',\n                reference : 'password',\n                inputType : 'password',\n                listeners : {\n                    specialkey : 'onFieldSpecialKey'\n                }\n            }]\n        }],\n        buttons : ['->', {\n            text : 'Login',\n            listeners : {\n                click : 'onLoginClick'\n            }\n        }]\n    });\n\n## Adding via remote configuration\n\nA server side script can be used to add Components which are generated dynamically on the server.\nAn example of adding a GridPanel to a TabPanel where the GridPanel is generated by the server\nbased on certain parameters:\n\n    // execute an Ajax request to invoke server side script:\n    Ext.Ajax.request({\n        url: 'gen-invoice-grid.php',\n        // send additional parameters to instruct server script\n        params: {\n            startDate: Ext.getCmp('start-date').getValue(),\n            endDate: Ext.getCmp('end-date').getValue()\n        },\n        // process the response object to add it to the TabPanel:\n        success: function(xhr) {\n            var newComponent = eval(xhr.responseText); // see discussion below\n            myTabPanel.add(newComponent); // add the component to the TabPanel\n            myTabPanel.setActiveTab(newComponent);\n        },\n        failure: function() {\n            Ext.Msg.alert(\"Grid create failed\", \"Server communication failure\");\n        }\n    });\n\nThe server script needs to return a JSON representation of a configuration object, which,\nwhen decoded will return a config object with an {@link Ext.Component#xtype xtype}. The server\nmight return the following JSON:\n\n    {\n        \"xtype\": 'grid',\n        \"title\": 'Invoice Report',\n        \"store\": {\n            \"model\": 'Invoice',\n            \"proxy\": {\n                \"type\": 'ajax',\n                \"url\": 'get-invoice-data.php',\n                \"reader\": {\n                    \"type\": 'json'\n                    \"record\": 'transaction',\n                    \"idProperty\": 'id',\n                    \"totalRecords\": 'total'\n                })\n            },\n            \"autoLoad\": {\n                \"params\": {\n                    \"startDate\": '01/01/2008',\n                    \"endDate\": '01/31/2008'\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        \"headers\": [\n            {\"header\": \"Customer\", \"width\": 250, \"dataIndex\": 'customer', \"sortable\": true},\n            {\"header\": \"Invoice Number\", \"width\": 120, \"dataIndex\": 'invNo', \"sortable\": true},\n            {\"header\": \"Invoice Date\", \"width\": 100, \"dataIndex\": 'date',\n             \"renderer\": Ext.util.Format.dateRenderer('M d, y'), \"sortable\": true},\n            {\"header\": \"Value\", \"width\": 120, \"dataIndex\": 'value', \"renderer\": 'usMoney',\n             \"sortable\": true}\n        ]\n    }\n\nWhen the above code fragment is passed through the `eval` function in the success handler\nof the Ajax request, the result will be a config object which, when added to a Container,\nwill cause instantiation of a GridPanel. **Be sure that the Container is configured with a layout\nwhich sizes and positions the child items to your requirements.**\n\n**Note:** since the code above is _generated_ by a server script, the `autoLoad` params\nfor the Store, the user's preferred date format, the metadata to allow generation of the Model\nlayout, and the ColumnModel can all be generated into the code since these are all known\non the server.\n",

To create an actual transition\nfrom one of these configs, use the {@link #createTransition} method. For example:\n\n    this.createTransition('select')\n\nA transition object can optionally specify a name, if it's different from\nthe key in the `{@link #cfg!transitions transitions}` config. For example:\n\n    transitions: {\n        layout: {\n            name: 'foo',\n            duration: 500\n        }\n    }\n\nOtherwise the name will be set automatically, for example:\n\n    transition.name = this.getId() + '-' + key\n\nTransition names (whether explicitly given or not) are prefixed by component ID\nto prevent transitions with the same name but on a different component from\ncancelling each other out.\n\nHowever, transitions with the same name on the same component will still cancel\neach other out, if created via {@link #createTransition} on the same selection\nor with no selection provided.\n\n`duration`, `ease` and `{@link #cfg!name name}` properties of transition objects in this config\nare reserved, and will be used to configure a `d3.transition` instance.\nHowever, transition objects may also have other properties that are related to\nthis transition. For example:\n\n    transitions: {\n        select: {\n            duration: 500,\n            ease: 'cubicInOut',\n            targetScale: 1.1\n        }\n    }\n\nThe `targetScale` property here won't be consumed by a `d3.transition` instance;\ninstead a component can make use of it in whichever way it sees fit to animate\nthe selected element.\n",

If `{@link #cfg!reference reference}` is not set then this config\nis ignored.\n\nBy using this config and `{@link #cfg-reference}` you can bind configs between\ncomponents. For example:\n\n     ...\n         items: [{\n             xtype: 'textfield',\n             reference: 'somefield',  // component's name in the ViewModel\n             publishes: 'value' // value is not published by default\n         },{\n             ...\n         },{\n             xtype: 'displayfield',\n             bind: 'You have entered \"{somefield.value}\"'\n         }]\n     ...\n\nClasses must provide this config as an Object:\n\n     Ext.define('App.foo.Bar', {\n         publishes: {\n             foo: true,\n             bar: true\n         }\n     });\n\nThis is required for the config system to properly merge values from derived\nclasses.\n\nFor instances this value can be specified as a value as show above or an array\nor object as follows:\n\n     {\n         xtype: 'textfield',\n         reference: 'somefield',\n         publishes: [\n             'value',\n             'rawValue',\n             'dirty'\n         ]\n     }\n\n     // This achieves the same result as the above array form.\n     {\n         xtype: 'textfield',\n         reference: 'somefield',\n         publishes: {\n             value: true,\n             rawValue: true,\n             dirty: true\n         }\n     }\n\nIn some cases, users may want to publish a property to the viewModel that is not found\nin a class  config block.

Generally a `Part` is a\ncomponent factory that allows all parts of a common type to be easily coordinated as\nneeded for that type. For example, an RSS feed might need certain configuration data to\nproperly initialize. Perahps not all of this data can or should be supplied from the UI\nthat creates new instances for the `Dashboard`.\n\n## Part Configuration\n\nThe primary role of a `Part` is to provide an abstract way to define the configuration\nneeded to create views. For example, an RSS Part would at least need the URL for the\nfeed.\n\nTo implement this a derived class provides a `{@link #method!displayForm displayForm}` method:\n\n     Ext.define('App.parts.RSS', {\n         extend: 'Ext.dashboard.Part',\n         alias: 'part.rss',\n\n         displayForm: function(instance, currentConfig, callback, scope) {\n             var me = this,\n                 title = instance ? 'Edit RSS Feed' : 'Add RSS Feed';\n\n             // Display a prompt using current URL as default text.\n             //\n             Ext.Msg.prompt(title, 'RSS Feed URL', function(btn, text) {\n                 if (btn === 'ok') {\n                     var config = {\n                         feedUrl: text\n                     };\n\n                     callback.call(scope || me, config);\n                 }\n             }, me, false, currentConfig ? currentConfig.feedUrl : '');\n         }\n     });\n\nThe returned configuration object is used to create views. It is also passed back to\n`{@link #method!displayForm displayForm}` to allow the user to edit the configuration for an existing view.\n\n## Creating Views\n\nThe next step is to define the view (the components) appropriate for the part. To\ncontinue with the above example.\n\n     Ext.define('App.parts.RSS', {\n         extend: 'Ext.dashboard.Part',\n         alias: 'part.rss',\n\n         // The viewTemplate is \"component template\" that is evaluated against the\n         // configuration (as returned by displayForm). The top-most component is\n         // a panel specific to the Dashboard so it can be configured but should\n         // not be replaced. Instead, fit an appropriate component to the panel.\n         //\n         viewTemplate: {\n             layout: 'fit',\n             items: [{\n                 xtype: 'feedpanel',\n                 feedUrl: '{feedUrl}'  // from the configuration object\n             }]\n         },\n\n         displayForm: ...\n     });\n\nYou can instead choose to override the `{@link #method!createView createView}` method if `{@link #cfg!viewTemplate viewTemplate}` does not\nprovide enough flexibility. It is usually a better solution to create a class (like\nin the above example) and pass basic configurations to it rather than over-complicate\neither the `{@link #cfg!viewTemplate viewTemplate}` or a custom `{@link #method!createView createView}` method.\n",

Only pages which\nhave been requested by the UI (usually a {@link Ext.grid.Panel GridPanel}) and surrounding pages\nwill be present. Retention of viewed pages in the BufferedStore after they have been scrolled\nout of view is configurable. See {@link #leadingBufferZone}, {@link #trailingBufferZone} and\n{@link #purgePageCount}.\n\nTo use a BufferedStore, initiate the loading process by loading the first page. The number of\nrows rendered are determined automatically, and the range of pages needed to keep the cache\nprimed for scrolling is requested and cached.\nExample:\n\n    myBufferedStore.loadPage(1); // Load page 1\n\nA {@link Ext.grid.plugin.BufferedRenderer BufferedRenderer} is instantiated which will monitor\nthe scrolling in the grid, and refresh the view's rows from the page cache as needed.

This is controlled by the {@link #purgePageCount} setting.\n\nSetting this value to zero means that no pages are *ever* scrolled out of the page cache, and\nthat eventually the whole dataset may become present in the page cache. This is sometimes\ndesirable as long as datasets do not reach astronomical proportions.\n\nSelection state may be maintained across page boundaries by configuring the SelectionModel\nnot to discard records from its collection when those Records cycle out of the Store's primary\ncollection.

Instead the form is submitted in the standard manner with the DOM\n&lt;form&gt; element temporarily modified to have its target set to refer to a dynamically\ngenerated, hidden &lt;iframe&gt; which is inserted into the document but removed after the\nreturn data has been gathered.\n\nThe server response is parsed by the browser to create the document for the IFRAME. If the\nserver is using JSON to send the return object, then the Content-Type header must be set to\n\"text/html\" in order to tell the browser to insert the text unchanged into the document body.\n\nCharacters which are significant to an HTML parser must be sent as HTML entities, so encode\n`<` as `&lt;`, `&` as `&amp;` etc.\n\nThe response text is retrieved from the document, and a fake XMLHttpRequest object is created\ncontaining a responseText property in order to conform to the requirements of event handlers and\ncallbacks.\n\nBe aware that file upload packets are sent with the content type multipart/form and some server\ntechnologies (notably JEE) may require some custom processing in order to retrieve parameter\nnames and parameter values from the packet content.\n\nAlso note that it's not possible to check the response code of the hidden iframe, so the success\nhandler will ALWAYS fire.\n\n# Binary Posts\n\nThe class supports posting binary data to the server by using native browser capabilities,\nor a flash polyfill plugin in browsers that do not support native binary posting (e.g.\nInternet Explorer version 9 or less). A number of limitations exist when the polyfill is used:\n\n- Only asynchronous connections are supported.\n- Only the POST method can be used.\n- The return data can only be binary for now. Set the {@link Ext.data.Connection#binary binary}\nparameter to `true`.\n- Only the 0, 1 and 4 (complete) readyState values will be reported to listeners.\n- The flash object will be injected at the bottom of the document and should be invisible.\n- Important: See note about packaing the flash plugin with the app in the documenetation of\n{@link Ext.data.flash.BinaryXhr BinaryXhr}.\n",

They aren't instantiated directly;\ninstead, when we create a class that extends {@link Ext.data.Model}, it automatically\ncreates Field instances for each field configured in a {@link Ext.data.Model Model}.\nFor example, we might set up a model like this:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            'name', 'email',\n            { name: 'age', type: 'int' },\n            { name: 'gender', type: 'string', defaultValue: 'Unknown' }\n        ]\n    });\n\nFour fields will have been created for the User Model - name, email, age and gender.\nNote that we specified a couple of different formats here; if we only pass in the string\nname of the field (as with name and email), the field is set up with the 'auto' type.\nIt's as if we'd done this instead:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            { name: 'name', type: 'auto' },\n            { name: 'email', type: 'auto' },\n            { name: 'age', type: 'int' },\n            { name: 'gender', type: 'string', defaultValue: 'Unknown' }\n        ]\n    });\n\n# Field Types\n\nFields come in various types. When declaring a field, the `type` property is used to\nspecify the type of `Field` derived class used to manage values.\n\nThe predefined set of types are:\n\n - {@link Ext.data.field.Field auto} (Default, implies no conversion)\n - {@link Ext.data.field.String string}\n - {@link Ext.data.field.Integer int}\n - {@link Ext.data.field.Number number}\n - {@link Ext.data.field.Boolean boolean}\n - {@link Ext.data.field.Date date}\n\n# Conversion\n\nWhen reading fields it is often necessary to convert the values received before using\nthem or storing them in records. To handle these cases there is the\n`{@link #method-convert convert}` method. This method is passed the received value (as\nwell as the current record instance, but see below) and it returns the value to carry\nforward.\n\nFor `auto` fields there is no `{@link #method-convert convert}` method. This is for\nefficiency. For other field types, there are often `convert` methods. You can provide\na `{@link #cfg-convert convert}` config when the field is defined like this:\n\n     {\n         name: 'timestamp',\n\n         convert: function (value) {\n             return new Date(value);\n         }\n     }\n\nWhile this can be convenient, see below for details on defining Custom Types as that is\noften a better practice and avoids repeating these functions.\n\nNote that when a `{@link #cfg!defaultValue defaultValue}` is specified, it will also be passed through to\n`convert` (either to the `{@link #method-convert convert}` method or to the\n`{@link #cfg-convert convert} config)`.\n\n## Calculated Values\n\nIn some cases fields are the result of a calculation from other fields. Historically\nthis was a second role for `{@link #method-convert convert}` but that has some short\ncomings. The simpler solution is the `{@link #cfg-calculate calculate}` config.\n\nValues produced by `{@link #cfg-calculate calculate}` and `{@link #method-convert convert}`\nare stored in the record as with any other field. In fact, if we define a calculated\n\"firstName\" field and log out all of the data, we'll see this:\n\n    var ed = Ext.create('User', { name: 'Ed Spencer' });\n\n    console.log(ed.data);\n\n    //outputs this:\n    {\n        age: 0,\n        email: \"\",\n        firstName: \"Ed\",  // calculated field\n        gender: \"Unknown\",\n        name: \"Ed Spencer\"\n    }\n\n### Using `{@link #cfg!calculate calculate}`\n\n     {\n         name: 'firstName',\n\n         calculate: function (data) {\n             return data.name.split(' ')[0];\n         }\n     }\n\nUsing `{@link #cfg-calculate calculate}` is the simplest and safest way to define a\ncalculated field. The most important part of this is that, internally, the code of the\nsupplied function is parsed to extract its dependencies. In this case, the \"name\" field\nis the only dependency. This means that \"firstName\" will only need to be recalculated\nwhen \"name\" is modified.\n\n**Note:** Fields used by the calculate method must be explicitly defined in the\n{@link Ext.data.Model#cfg-fields #fields} of the model.\n\n### Using `convert`\n\nFollowing is the equivalent technique using `{@link #cfg-convert convert}`\n\n     {\n         name: 'firstName',\n\n         convert: function (value, record) {\n             return record.get('name').split(' ')[0];\n         },\n\n         depends: [ 'name' ]\n     }\n\nWhen a `{@link #method-convert convert}` function accepts a 2nd argument (a reference to\nthe record), it is considered a calculated field. If a `{@link #cfg-depends depends}`\nconfig is not provided then this field's dependencies are unknown. In this case, the\n`{@link #cfg-depends depends}` are provided as would be automatically determined with\nthe `{@link #cfg-calculate calculate}` config.\n\n### Updating\n\nFields modified with the {@link Ext.data.Model#set set} method will have their stored\nvalue set using the convert / calculate method when present.\n\nFor example:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.model.Employee', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'salary',\n            convert: function (val) {\n                var startingBonus = val * .1;\n                return val + startingBonus;\n            }\n        }],\n        convertOnSet: false\n    });\n\n    var tina = Ext.create('MyApp.model.Employee', {\n        salary: 50000\n    });\n\n    console.log(tina.get('salary')); // logs 55000\n\n    tina.set('salary', 60000);\n    console.log(tina.get('salary')); // logs 60000\n\nThis default behavior can be disabled by setting the Model's\n`{@link Ext.data.Model#cfg-convertOnSet}` config to `false`.\n\n**Note:** convertOnSet `false` only prevents the convert / calculate call when the\nset `fieldName` param matches the field's `{@link #name}`.  See\n{@link Ext.data.Model#convertOnSet convertOnSet} for additional details.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nWhen a field's `{@link #method-convert convert}` method processes values from the record\n(vs. just the field's value), it is best to also provide a `{@link #cfg!depends depends}` config as shown\nabove. Fields that provide a `{@link #cfg-calculate calculate}` method must follow the\nproper form for using fields so that dependencies can be extracted.\n\nCalculated fields are processed after other fields based on their dependencies. Fields\nwith `{@link #method-convert convert}` methods that use the provided record that do *not*\nspecify a `{@link #cfg-depends depends}` config are processed as a group after all other\nfields since such converters can rely on anything in the record. The order of processing\nthese fields with respect to each other is unspecified and should not be relied upon.\n\n# Serialization\n\nTo handle the inverse scenario of `convert` there is the `serialize` method. This\nmethod is called to produce the value to send to a server based on the internal value\nas would be returned from `convert`. In most cases, these methods should \"round trip\"\na value:\n\n     assertEqual(value, field.serialize(field.convert(value)));\n\nBy default, only `{@link Ext.data.field.Date date}` fields have a `serialize` method.\nOther types simply send their value unmodified.\n\n# Custom Types\n\nDevelopers may create their own application-specific data types by deriving from this\nclass. This is typically much better than applying multiple configuration values on\nfield instances as these often become repetitive.\n\nTo illustrate, we define a \"time\" field type that stores a time-of-day represented as a\nnumber of minutes since Midnight.\n\n     Ext.define('App.field.Time', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.field.Field',\n\n         alias: 'data.field.time',\n\n         timeFormat: 'g:i',\n\n         convert: function (value) {\n             if (value && Ext.isString(value)) {\n                 var date = Ext.Date.parse(value, this.timeFormat);\n                 if (!date) {\n                     return null;\n                 }\n                 return (date.getHours() - 1) * 60 + date.getMinutes();\n             }\n             return value;\n         }\n     });\n\n## Validation\n\nCustom field types can override the `{@link #method-validate validate}` method or\nprovide a set of `{@link #cfg-validators validators}`.\n\n     Ext.define('App.field.PhoneNumber', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.field.Field',\n\n         alias: 'data.field.phonenumber',\n\n         // Match U.S. phone numbers for example purposes\n         validators: {\n             type: 'format',\n             matcher: /\\d{3}\\-\\d{3}\\-\\d{4}/\n         }\n     });\n\nOnce the class is defined, fields can be declared using the new type (based on its\n`alias`) like so:\n\n     Ext.define('App.model.PhoneCall', {\n         fields: [\n             { name: 'startTime', type: 'time' },\n             { name: 'phoneNumber', type: 'phonenumber' }\n         ]\n     });\n",

        "doc": "This class is a base for all id generators. It also provides lookup of id generators by\ntheir id.\n\nGenerally, id generators are used to generate a primary key for new model instances. There\nare different approaches to solving this problem, so this mechanism has both simple use\ncases and is open to custom implementations. A {@link Ext.data.Model} requests id generation\nusing the {@link Ext.data.Model#identifier} property.\n\nThe following types of `identifiers` are provided:\n\n  * `{@link Ext.data.identifier.Sequential sequential}`\n  * `{@link Ext.data.identifier.Negative negative}`\n  * `{@link Ext.data.identifier.Uuid uuid}`\n\nIn most cases (other than `uuid`), the server is the only party that can generate\nauthoritative id values. This means that any id generated by an `identifier` should be\nconsider \"provisional\" and must eventually be reconciled with the server. This makes a\n`uuid` very attractive as an `identifier` because they are designed to be generated in\na distributed manner and therefore never require reconciliation.\n\nIt is common for id values to be generated as increasing integer values (1, 2, etc.) by\nthe server when records are inserted. A `{@link Ext.data.identifier.Negative negative}`\n`identifier` may be useful as it generates client-side values of -1, -2, etc.. These\nvalues are of the same data type (integer) and so can typically be read by servers\nusing typed languages (such as Java or C#) and easily recognized as provisional.\n\nIn the end, the choice of `identifier` strategy requires agreement between client and\nserver.\n\n# Identity, Type and Shared Generators\n\nIt is often desirable to share Generators to ensure uniqueness or common configuration.\nThis is done by giving Generator instances an id property by which they can be looked\nup using the {@link Ext.Factory#dataIdentifier dataIdentifier} method. To configure two\n{@link Ext.data.Model Model} classes to share one\n{@link Ext.data.identifier.Sequential sequential} id generator, you simply assign them\nthe same id:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModelA', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: {\n            type: 'sequential',\n            id: 'foo'\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModelB', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: {\n            type: 'sequential',\n            id: 'foo'\n        }\n    });\n\nTo make this as simple as possible for generator types that are shared by many (or all)\nModels, the Generator types (such as 'sequential' or 'uuid') are also reserved as\ngenerator ids. This is used by the {@link Ext.data.identifier.Uuid} which has an id equal\nto its type ('uuid'). In other words, the following Models share the same generator:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModelX', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: 'uuid'\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModelY', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: 'uuid'\n    });\n\nThis can be overridden (by specifying the id explicitly), but there is no particularly\ngood reason to do so for this generator type.\n\n# Creating Custom Generators\n\nAn id generator should derive from this class and implement the {@link #generate} method.\n\nTo register an id generator type, a derived class should provide an `alias` like so:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.identifier.Custom', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.identifier.Generator',\n        alias: 'data.identifier.custom',\n        config: {\n            configProp: 42 // some config property w/default value\n        }\n\n        generate: function () {\n            return ... // a new id\n        }\n    });\n\nUsing the custom id generator is then straightforward:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModel', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: 'custom'\n    });\n    // or...\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModel', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: {\n            type: 'custom',\n            configProp: value\n        }\n    });\n\nIt is not recommended to mix shared generators with generator configuration. This leads\nto unpredictable results unless all configurations match (which is also redundant). In\nsuch cases, a custom generator with a default id is the best approach.\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.identifier.Custom', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.identifier.Sequential',\n        alias: 'data.identifier.custom',\n\n        config: {\n            id: 'custom',\n            prefix: 'ID_',\n            seed: 1000\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModelX', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: 'custom'\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.data.MyModelY', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        identifier: 'custom'\n    });\n\n    // the above models share a generator that produces ID_1000, ID_1001, etc..\n",

For example:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            {name: 'name',  type: 'string'},\n            {name: 'age',   type: 'int', convert: null},\n            {name: 'phone', type: 'string'},\n            {name: 'alive', type: 'boolean', defaultValue: true, convert: null}\n        ],\n\n        changeName: function() {\n            var oldName = this.get('name'),\n                newName = oldName + \" The Barbarian\";\n\n            this.set('name', newName);\n        }\n    });\n\nNow we can create instances of our User model and call any model logic we defined:\n\n    var user = Ext.create('User', {\n        id   : 'ABCD12345',\n        name : 'Conan',\n        age  : 24,\n        phone: '555-555-5555'\n    });\n\n    user.changeName();\n    user.get('name'); //returns \"Conan The Barbarian\"\n\nBy default, the built in field types such as number and boolean coerce string values\nin the raw data by virtue of their {@link Ext.data.field.Field#method-convert} method.\nWhen the server can be relied upon to send data in a format that does not need to be\nconverted, disabling this can improve performance. The {@link Ext.data.reader.Json Json}\nand {@link Ext.data.reader.Array Array} readers are likely candidates for this\noptimization. To disable field conversions you simply specify `null` for the field's\n{@link Ext.data.field.Field#cfg-convert convert config}.\n\n## The \"id\" Field and `{@link #cfg!idProperty idProperty}`\n\nA Model definition always has an *identifying field* which should yield a unique key\nfor each instance. By default, a field named \"id\" will be created with a\n{@link Ext.data.Field#mapping mapping} of \"id\". This happens because of the default\n{@link #idProperty} provided in Model definitions.\n\nTo alter which field is the identifying field, use the {@link #idProperty} config.\n\n# Validators\n\nModels have built-in support for field validators. Validators are added to models as in\nthe follow example:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            { name: 'name',     type: 'string' },\n            { name: 'age',      type: 'int' },\n            { name: 'phone',    type: 'string' },\n            { name: 'gender',   type: 'string' },\n            { name: 'username', type: 'string' },\n            { name: 'alive',    type: 'boolean', defaultValue: true }\n        ],\n\n        validators: {\n            age: 'presence',\n            name: { type: 'length', min: 2 },\n            gender: { type: 'inclusion', list: ['Male', 'Female'] },\n            username: [\n                { type: 'exclusion', list: ['Admin', 'Operator'] },\n                { type: 'format', matcher: /([a-z]+)[0-9]{2,3}/i }\n            ]\n        }\n    });\n\nThe derived type of `{@link Ext.data.field.Field}` can also provide validation. If `{@link #cfg!validators validators}`\nneed to be duplicated on multiple fields, instead consider creating a custom field type.\n\n## Validation\n\nThe results of the validators can be retrieved via the \"associated\" validation record:\n\n    var instance = Ext.create('User', {\n        name: 'Ed',\n        gender: 'Male',\n        username: 'edspencer'\n    });\n\n    var validation = instance.getValidation();\n\nThe returned object is an instance of `{@link Ext.data.Validation}` and has as its fields the\nresult of the field `{@link #cfg!validators validators}`. The validation object is \"dirty\" if there are one or\nmore validation errors present.\n\nThis record is also available when using data binding as a \"pseudo-association\" called\n\"validation\". This pseudo-association can be hidden by an explicitly declared\nassociation by the same name (for compatibility reasons), but doing so is not\nrecommended.\n\nThe `{@link Ext.Component#modelValidation}` config can be used to enable automatic\nbinding from the \"validation\" of a record to the form fields that may be bound to its\nvalues.\n\n# Associations\n\nModels often have associations with other Models. These associations can be defined by\nfields (often called \"foreign keys\") or by other data such as a many-to-many (or \"matrix\").\nSee {@link Ext.data.schema.Association} for information about configuring and using associations.\n\n# Using a Proxy\n\nModels are great for representing types of data and relationships, but sooner or later we're\ngoing to want to load or save that data somewhere. All loading and saving of data is handled\nvia a {@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy Proxy}, which can be set directly on the Model:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'name', 'email'],\n\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'rest',\n            url : '/users'\n        }\n    });\n\nHere we've set up a {@link Ext.data.proxy.Rest Rest Proxy}, which knows how to load and save\ndata to and from a RESTful backend. Let's see how this works:\n\n    var user = Ext.create('User', {name: 'Ed Spencer', email: 'ed@sencha.com'});\n\n    user.save(); //POST /users\n\nCalling {@link #save} on the new Model instance tells the configured RestProxy that we wish to\npersist this Model's data onto our server. RestProxy figures out that this Model hasn't been\nsaved before because it doesn't have an id, and performs the appropriate action - in this case\nissuing a POST request to the url we configured (/users). We configure any Proxy on any Model\nand always follow this API - see {@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy} for a full list.\n\nLoading data via the Proxy is accomplished with the static `load` method:\n\n    // Uses the configured RestProxy to make a GET request to /users/123\n    User.load(123, {\n        success: function(user) {\n            console.log(user.getId()); //logs 123\n        }\n    });\n\nModels can also be updated and destroyed easily:\n\n    // the user Model we loaded in the last snippet:\n    user.set('name', 'Edward Spencer');\n\n    // tells the Proxy to save the Model. In this case it will perform a PUT request\n    // to /users/123 as this Model already has an id\n    user.save({\n        success: function() {\n            console.log('The User was updated');\n        }\n    });\n\n    // tells the Proxy to destroy the Model. Performs a DELETE request to /users/123\n    user.erase({\n        success: function() {\n            console.log('The User was destroyed!');\n        }\n    });\n\n# HTTP Parameter names when using a {@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax Ajax proxy}\n\nBy default, the model ID is specified in an HTTP parameter named `id`. To change the\nname of this parameter use the Proxy's {@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax#idParam idParam}\nconfiguration.\n\nParameters for other commonly passed values such as\n{@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax#pageParam page number} or\n{@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax#startParam start row} may also be configured.\n\n# Usage in Stores\n\nIt is very common to want to load a set of Model instances to be displayed and manipulated\nin the UI. We do this by creating a {@link Ext.data.Store Store}:\n\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: 'User'\n    });\n\n    //uses the Proxy we set up on Model to load the Store data\n    store.load();\n\nA Store is just a collection of Model instances - usually loaded from a server somewhere. Store\ncan also maintain a set of added, updated and removed Model instances to be synchronized with\nthe server via the Proxy. See the {@link Ext.data.Store Store docs} for more information\non Stores.\n",

Alternatively,\nthe server could respond with records that correspond one-to-one to those sent in\nthe `operation`.\n\nFor example the client could send a `{@link #static-method!create create}` with this data:\n\n     [ { id: -1, name: 'Clark Kent' },\n       { id: -2, name: 'Peter Parker' },\n       { id: -3, name: 'Bruce Banner' } ]\n\nAnd the server could respond in the same order:\n\n     [ { id: 427 },      // updates id = -1\n       { id: 428 },      // updates id = -2\n       { id: 429 } ]     // updates id = -3\n\nOr using `{@link #cfg!clientIdProperty clientIdProperty}` the server could respond in arbitrary order:\n\n     [ { id: 427, clientId: -3 },\n       { id: 428, clientId: -1 },\n       { id: 429, clientId: -2 } ]\n\n**IMPORTANT:** When upgrading from previous versions be aware that this property\nused to perform the role of `{@link Ext.data.writer.Writer#clientIdProperty}` as\nwell as that described above. To continue send a client-generated id as other than\nthe `{@link #cfg!idProperty idProperty}`, set `{@link #cfg!clientIdProperty clientIdProperty}` on the `writer`. A better solution, however,\nis most likely a properly configured `{@link #cfg!identifier identifier}` as that would work better with\nassociations.\n",

        "doc": "AjaxProxy is one of the most widely-used ways of getting data into your application. It uses AJAX\nrequests to load data from the server, usually to be placed into a {@link Ext.data.Store Store}.\nLet's take a look at a typical setup. Here we're going to set up a Store that has an Ajax Proxy.\nTo prepare, we'll also set up a {@link Ext.data.Model Model}:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'name', 'email']\n    });\n\n    // The Store contains the AjaxProxy as an inline configuration\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: 'User',\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'ajax',\n            url: 'users.json'\n        }\n    });\n\n    store.load();\n\nOur example is going to load user data into a Store, so we start off by defining a\n{@link Ext.data.Model Model} with the fields that we expect the server to return. Next we set up\nthe Store itself, along with a {@link Ext.data.Store#proxy proxy} configuration.\nThis configuration was automatically turned into an Ext.data.proxy.Ajax instance, with the url\nwe specified being passed into AjaxProxy's constructor. It's as if we'd done this:\n\n    new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n        url: 'users.json',\n        model: 'User',\n        reader: 'json'\n    });\n\nA couple of extra configurations appeared here - {@link #model} and {@link #reader}. These are\nset by default when we create the proxy via the Store - the Store already knows about the Model,\nand Proxy's default {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader Reader} is\n{@link Ext.data.reader.Json JsonReader}.\n\nNow when we call store.load(), the AjaxProxy springs into action, making a request to the url\nwe configured ('users.json' in this case). As we're performing a read, it sends a GET request\nto that url (see {@link #actionMethods} to customize this - by default any kind of read will be\nsent as a GET request and any kind of write will be sent as a POST request).\n\n# Limitations\n\nAjaxProxy cannot be used to retrieve data from other domains. If your application is running\non http://domainA.com it cannot load data from http://domainB.com because browsers have\na built-in security policy that prohibits domains talking to each other via AJAX.\n\nIf you need to read data from another domain and can't set up a proxy server (some software\nthat runs on your own domain's web server and transparently forwards requests to\nhttp://domainB.com, making it look like they actually came from http://domainA.com), you can use\n{@link Ext.data.proxy.JsonP} and a technique known as JSON-P (JSON with Padding), which can help\nyou get around the problem so long as the server on http://domainB.com is set up to support\nJSON-P responses. See {@link Ext.data.proxy.JsonP JsonPProxy}'s introduction docs for more\ndetails.\n\n# Readers and Writers\n\nAjaxProxy can be configured to use any type of {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader Reader} to decode\nthe server's response. If no Reader is supplied, AjaxProxy will default to using a\n{@link Ext.data.reader.Json JsonReader}. Reader configuration can be passed in as a simple\nobject, which the Proxy automatically turns into a {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader Reader}\ninstance:\n\n    var proxy = new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n        model: 'User',\n        reader: {\n            type: 'xml',\n            rootProperty: 'users'\n        }\n    });\n\n    proxy.getReader(); // returns an XmlReader instance based on the config we supplied\n\n# Url generation\n\nAjaxProxy automatically inserts any sorting, filtering, paging and grouping options into the url\nit generates for each request. These are controlled with the following configuration options:\n\n- {@link #pageParam} - controls how the page number is sent to the server (see also\n  {@link #startParam} and {@link #limitParam})\n- {@link #sortParam} - controls how sort information is sent to the server\n- {@link #groupParam} - controls how grouping information is sent to the server\n- {@link #filterParam} - controls how filter information is sent to the server\n\nEach request sent by AjaxProxy is described by an {@link Ext.data.operation.Operation Operation}.\nTo see how we can customize the generated urls, let's say we're loading the Proxy\nwith the following Operation:\n\n    var proxy = new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n        url: '/users'\n    });\n\n    var operation = proxy.createOperation('read', {\n        page: 2\n    });\n\nNow we'll issue the request for this Operation by calling {@link #read}:\n\n    proxy.read(operation); // GET /users?page=2\n\nEasy enough - the Proxy just copied the page property from the Operation. We can customize\nhow this page data is sent to the server:\n\n    var proxy = new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n        url: '/users',\n        pageParam: 'pageNumber'\n    });\n\n    proxy.read(operation); // GET /users?pageNumber=2\n\nAlternatively, our Operation could have been configured to send start and limit parameters\ninstead of page:\n\n    var proxy = new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n        url: '/users'\n    });\n\n    var operation = proxy.createOperation('read', {\n        start: 50,\n        limit: 25\n    });\n\n    proxy.read(operation); // GET /users?start=50&limit;=25\n\nAgain we can customize this url:\n\n    var proxy = new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n        url: '/users',\n        startParam: 'startIndex',\n        limitParam: 'limitIndex'\n    });\n\n    proxy.read(operation); // GET /users?startIndex=50&limitIndex;=25\n\nAjaxProxy will also send sort and filter information to the server. Let's take a look at how\nthis looks with a more expressive Operation object:\n\n    var operation = proxy.createOperation('read', {\n        sorters: [\n            new Ext.util.Sorter({\n                property: 'name',\n                direction: 'ASC'\n            }),\n            new Ext.util.Sorter({\n                property: 'age',\n                direction: 'DESC'\n            })\n        ],\n        filters: [\n            new Ext.util.Filter({\n                property: 'eyeColor',\n                value: 'brown'\n            })\n        ]\n    });\n\nThis is the type of object that is generated internally when loading a\n{@link Ext.data.Store Store} with sorters and filters defined. By default the AjaxProxy will\nJSON encode the sorters and filters, resulting in something like this (note that the url\nis escaped before sending the request, but is left unescaped here for clarity):\n\n    var proxy = new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n        url: '/users'\n    });\n\n    // GET /users?sort=[{\"property\":\"name\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"},\n                        {\"property\":\"age\",\"direction\":\"DESC\"}]\n                        &filter;=[{\"property\":\"eyeColor\",\"value\":\"brown\"}]\n    proxy.read(operation);\n\nWe can again customize how this is created by supplying a few configuration options. Let's say\nour server is set up to receive sorting information is a format like \"sortBy=name#ASC,age#DESC\".\nWe can configure AjaxProxy to provide that format like this:\n\n     var proxy = new Ext.data.proxy.Ajax({\n         url: '/users',\n         sortParam: 'sortBy',\n         filterParam: 'filterBy',\n\n         // our custom implementation of sorter encoding -\n         // turns our sorters into \"name#ASC,age#DESC\"\n         encodeSorters: function(sorters) {\n             var length = sorters.length,\n                 sortStrs = [],\n                 sorter, i;\n\n             for (i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n                 sorter = sorters[i];\n\n                 sortStrs[i] = sorter.property + '#' + sorter.direction\n             }\n\n             return sortStrs.join(\",\");\n         }\n     });\n\n     // GET /users?sortBy=name#ASC,age#DESC&filterBy;=[{\"property\":\"eyeColor\",\"value\":\"brown\"}]\n     proxy.read(operation);\n\nWe can also provide a custom {@link #encodeFilters} function to encode our filters.\n\n# Debugging your Ajax Proxy\n\nIf the data is not being loaded into the store as expected, it could be due to a mismatch\nbetween the the way that the {@link #reader} is configured, and the shape of the incoming data.\n\nTo debug from the point that your data arrives back from the network, set a breakpoint inside\nthe callback function created in the `{@link #method!createRequestCallback createRequestCallback}` method of the Ajax Proxy class,\nand follow the data to where the {@link #reader} attempts to consume it.\n",

By setting the {@link #paramsAsHash} option to `true`, the proxy will\nsend an object literal containing each of the passed parameters. This is the default. When\n{@link #paramsAsHash} is set to `false`, Proxy will pass the Read function an array of values\ninstead of an object, with the order determined by {@link #paramOrder} value.\n\nSetting {@link #paramOrder} to any value other than `undefined` will automatically reset\n{@link #paramsAsHash} to `false`.\n\n# Example Usage\n\n     Ext.define('User', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n         fields: ['firstName', 'lastName']\n     });\n\n     Ext.define('Users', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.Store',\n         model: 'User',\n         proxy: {\n             type: 'direct',\n             directFn: 'MyApp.getUsers',\n             // Tells the proxy to pass `start` and `limit` as two by-position arguments:\n             paramOrder: 'start,limit'\n         }\n     });\n\n     var store = new Users();\n     store.load();\n",

        "doc": "The JsonP proxy is useful when you need to load data from a domain other than the one your\napplication is running on. If your application is running on http://domainA.com it cannot use\n{@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax Ajax} to load its data from http://domainB.com because cross-domain\nAjax requests are prohibited by the browser.\n\nWe can get around this using a JsonP proxy. JsonP proxy injects a `<script>` tag into the DOM\nwhenever an AJAX request would usually be made. Let's say we want to load data from\nhttp://domainB.com/users - the script tag that would be injected might look like this:\n\n    <script src=\"http://domainB.com/users?callback=someCallback\"></script>\n\nWhen we inject the tag above, the browser makes a request to that url and includes the response\nas if it was any other type of JavaScript include. By passing a callback in the url above,\nwe're telling domainB's server that we want to be notified when the result comes in and that it\nshould call our callback function with the data it sends back. So long as the server formats\nthe response to look like this, everything will work:\n\n    someCallback({\n        users: [\n            {\n                id: 1,\n                name: \"Ed Spencer\",\n                email: \"ed@sencha.com\"\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n\nAs soon as the script finishes loading, the 'someCallback' function that we passed in the url\nis called with the JSON object that the server returned.\n\nJsonP proxy takes care of all of this automatically. It formats the url you pass, adding\nthe callback parameter automatically. It even creates a temporary callback function, waits for it\nto be called and then puts the data into the Proxy making it look just like you loaded it\nthrough a normal {@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax AjaxProxy}. Here's how we might set that up:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'name', 'email']\n    });\n\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: 'User',\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'jsonp',\n            url: 'http://domainB.com/users'\n        }\n    });\n\n    store.load();\n\nThat's all we need to do - JsonP proxy takes care of the rest. In this case the Proxy will have\ninjected a script tag like this:\n\n    <script src=\"http://domainB.com/users?callback=callback1\"></script>\n\n# Customization\n\nThis script tag can be customized using the {@link #callbackKey} configuration. For example:\n\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: 'User',\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'jsonp',\n            url : 'http://domainB.com/users',\n            callbackKey: 'theCallbackFunction'\n        }\n    });\n\n    store.load();\n\nWould inject a script tag like this:\n\n    <script src=\"http://domainB.com/users?theCallbackFunction=callback1\"></script>\n\n# Implementing on the server side\n\nThe remote server side needs to be configured to return data in this format. Here are suggestions\nfor how you might achieve this using Java, PHP and ASP.net:\n\nJava:\n\n    boolean jsonP = false;\n    String cb = request.getParameter(\"callback\");\n    if (cb != null) {\n        jsonP = true;\n        response.setContentType(\"text/javascript\");\n    } else {\n        response.setContentType(\"application/x-json\");\n    }\n    Writer out = response.getWriter();\n    if (jsonP) {\n        out.write(cb + \"(\");\n    }\n    out.print(dataBlock.toJsonString());\n    if (jsonP) {\n        out.write(\");\");\n    }\n\nPHP:\n\n    $callback = $_REQUEST['callback'];\n\n    // Create the output object.\n    $output = array('a' => 'Apple', 'b' => 'Banana');\n\n    //start output\n    if ($callback) {\n        header('Content-Type: text/javascript');\n        echo $callback . '(' . json_encode($output) . ');';\n    } else {\n        header('Content-Type: application/x-json');\n        echo json_encode($output);\n    }\n\nASP.net:\n\n    String jsonString = \"{\"success\": true}\";\n    String cb = Request.Params.Get(\"callback\");\n    String responseString = \"\";\n    if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(cb)) {\n        responseString = cb + \"(\" + jsonString + \")\";\n    } else {\n        responseString = jsonString;\n    }\n    Response.Write(responseString);\n",

        "doc": "The LocalStorageProxy uses the new HTML5 localStorage API to save {@link Ext.data.Model Model}\ndata locally on the client browser. HTML5 localStorage is a key-value store (e.g. cannot save\ncomplex objects like JSON), so LocalStorageProxy automatically serializes and deserializes data\nwhen saving and retrieving it.\n\nlocalStorage is extremely useful for saving user-specific information without needing to build\nserver-side infrastructure to support it. Let's imagine we're writing a Twitter search\napplication and want to save the user's searches locally so they can easily perform a saved\nsearch again later. We'd start by creating a Search model:\n\n    Ext.define('Search', {\n        fields: ['id', 'query'],\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'localstorage',\n            id: 'twitter-Searches'\n        }\n    });\n\nOur Search model contains just two fields - id and query - plus a Proxy definition. The only\nconfiguration we need to pass to the LocalStorage proxy is an {@link #id}. This is important\nas it separates the Model data in this Proxy from all others. The localStorage API puts all data\ninto a single shared namespace, so by setting an id we enable LocalStorageProxy to manage\nthe saved Search data.\n\nSaving our data into localStorage is easy and would usually be done with a\n{@link Ext.data.Store Store}:\n\n    // our Store automatically picks up the LocalStorageProxy defined on the Search model\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: \"Search\"\n    });\n\n    // loads any existing Search data from localStorage\n    store.load();\n\n    // now add some Searches\n    store.add({ query: 'Sencha Touch' });\n    store.add({ query: 'Ext JS' });\n\n    // finally, save our Search data to localStorage\n    store.sync();\n\nThe LocalStorageProxy automatically gives our new Searches an id when we call store.sync().\nIt encodes the Model data and places it into localStorage. We can also save directly\nto localStorage, bypassing the Store altogether:\n\n    var search = Ext.create('Search', { query: 'Sencha Animator' });\n\n    // uses the configured LocalStorageProxy to save the new Search to localStorage\n    search.save();\n\n# Limitations\n\nIf this proxy is used in a browser where local storage is not supported, the constructor\nwill throw an error. A local storage proxy requires a unique ID which is used as a key in which\nall record data are stored in the local storage object.\n\nIt's important to supply this unique ID as it cannot be reliably determined otherwise. If no id\nis provided but the attached store has a storeId, the storeId will be used. If neither option\nis presented the proxy will throw an error.\n",

These proxies\ninclude:\n\n- {@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax Ajax} - sends requests to a server on the same domain\n- {@link Ext.data.proxy.JsonP JsonP} - uses JSON-P to send requests to a server on a different\n  domain\n- {@link Ext.data.proxy.Rest Rest} - uses RESTful HTTP methods (GET/PUT/POST/DELETE)\n  to communicate with server\n- {@link Ext.data.proxy.Direct Direct} - uses {@link Ext.direct.Manager} to send requests\n\nProxies operate on the principle that all operations performed are either Create, Read, Update\nor Delete.

        "doc": "The Rest proxy is a specialization of the {@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax AjaxProxy} which simply maps\nthe four actions (create, read, update and destroy) to RESTful HTTP verbs. For example, let's\nset up a {@link Ext.data.Model Model} with an inline Rest proxy\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'name', 'email'],\n\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'rest',\n            url: '/users'\n        }\n    });\n\nNow we can create a new User instance and save it via the Rest proxy. Doing this will cause\nthe Proxy to send a POST request to '/users':\n\n    var user = Ext.create('User', { name: 'Ed Spencer', email: 'ed@sencha.com' });\n\n    user.save(); // POST /users\n\nLet's expand this a little and provide a callback for the {@link Ext.data.Model#save} call\nto update the Model once it has been created. We'll assume the creation went successfully\nand that the server gave this user an ID of 123:\n\n    user.save({\n        success: function(user) {\n            user.set('name', 'Khan Noonien Singh');\n\n            user.save(); // PUT /users/123\n        }\n    });\n\nNow that we're no longer creating a new Model instance, the request method is changed to an\nHTTP PUT, targeting the relevant url for that user. Now let's delete this user, which will use\nthe DELETE method:\n\n        user.erase(); // DELETE /users/123\n\nFinally, when we perform a load of a Model or Store, Rest proxy will use the GET method:\n\n    // 1. Load via Store\n\n    // the Store automatically picks up the Proxy from the User model\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: 'User'\n    });\n\n    store.load(); // GET /users\n\n    // 2. Load directly from the Model\n\n    // GET /users/123\n    User.load(123, {\n        success: function(user) {\n            console.log(user.getId()); // outputs 123\n        }\n    });\n\n# Url generation\n\nThe Rest proxy is able to automatically generate the urls above based on two configuration\noptions - {@link #appendId} and {@link #format}. If appendId is true (it is by default) then\nRest proxy will automatically append the ID of the Model instance in question to the configured\nurl, resulting in the '/users/123' that we saw above.\n\nIf the request is not for a specific Model instance (e.g. loading a Store), the url is not\nappended with an id. The Rest proxy will automatically insert a '/' before the ID if one is not\nalready present.\n\n    new Ext.data.proxy.Rest({\n        url: '/users',\n        appendId: true // default\n    });\n\n    // Collection url: /users\n    // Instance url: /users/123\n\nThe Rest proxy can also optionally append a format string to the end of any generated url:\n\n    new Ext.data.proxy.Rest({\n        url: '/users',\n        format: 'json'\n    });\n\n    // Collection url: /users.json\n    // Instance url: /users/123.json\n\nIf further customization is needed, simply implement the {@link #buildUrl} method and add your\ncustom generated url onto the {@link Ext.data.Request Request} object that is passed to buildUrl.\nSee [Rest proxy's implementation][1] for an example of how to achieve this.\n\nNote that Rest proxy inherits from {@link Ext.data.proxy.Ajax AjaxProxy}, which already injects\nall of the sorter, filter, group and paging options into the generated url.

If you're still\ninterested, here's a brief description of what ProxyStore is and is not.\n\nProxyStore provides the basic configuration for anything that can be considered a Store.\nIt expects to be given a {@link Ext.data.Model Model} that represents the type of data\nin the Store. It also expects to be given a {@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy Proxy} that handles\nthe loading of data into the Store.\n\nProxyStore provides a few helpful methods such as {@link #method-load} and {@link #sync},\nwhich load and save data respectively, passing the requests through the configured\n{@link #proxy}.\n\nBuilt-in Store subclasses add extra behavior to each of these functions. Note also that each\nProxyStore subclass has its own way of storing data - in {@link Ext.data.Store} the data\nis saved as a flat {@link Ext.util.Collection Collection}, whereas in\n{@link Ext.data.BufferedStore BufferedStore} we use a {@link Ext.data.PageMap} to maintain\na client side cache of pages of records.\n\nThe store provides filtering and sorting support. This sorting/filtering can happen on the\nclient side or can be completed on the server. This is controlled by the\n{@link Ext.data.Store#remoteSort remoteSort} and {@link Ext.data.Store#remoteFilter remoteFilter}\nconfig options.

For example:\n\n     store.addFilter(new Ext.data.Query('name like \"Bob\" or age < 20'));\n\nQueries can also be assigned an `{@link #cfg!id id}`:\n\n     store.addFilter(new Ext.data.Query({\n         id: 'myquery',\n         source: 'name like \"Bob\" or age < 20'\n     ));\n\n## Query Syntax\n\nThe syntax for a query is SQL-like. The goal of the query syntax is to be as natural\nto end-users as possible and therefore does not exactly match JavaScript.\n\n### Keyword Operators\n\n - `and` or `&&` - Logical AND\n - `or` or `||` - Logical OR\n - `like` - String containment or regex match\n - `in` - Set membership\n - `not` or `!` - Logical negation\n - `between` - Bounds check a value (`age between 18 and 99`)\n\n#### The `like` Operator\n\nThere are several forms of `like`. The first uses a simple string on the right-side:\n\n     name like \"Bob\"\n\nThis expression evaluates as `true` if the `name` contains the substring `'Bob'`\n(ignoring case).\n\nThe second form will be more typical of those familiar with SQL. It is when the\nright-side uses the SQL `%` or `_` wildcards (or the shell `*` or `?` wildcards) and/or\ncharacter sets (such as `'[a-f]'` and `'[^abc]'`):\n\n     name like \"[BR]ob%\"\n\nIf any wildcards are used, the typical SQL meaning is assumed (strict match, including\ncase).\n\nThe right-side can also use shell wildcards `'*'` or `'?'` instead of SQL wildcards.\n\nThese wildcards can be escaped with a backslash (`\\`) character (the `escape` keyword\nis not supported).\n\n     text like 'To be or not to be\\?'\n\nThe final form of `like` is when the right-side is a regular expression:\n\n     name like /^Bob/i\n\nThis form uses the `test()` method of the `RegExp` to match the value of `name`.\n\n#### The `in` Operator\n\nThis operator accepts a parenthesized list of values and evaluates to `true` if the\nleft-side value matches an item in the right-side list:\n\n     name in (\"Bob\", 'Robert')\n\n### Relational Operators\n\n - `<`\n - `<=`\n - `>`\n - `>=`\n\n### Equality and Inequality\n\n - `=` - Equality after conversion (like `==` in JavaScript)\n - `==` or `===` - Strict equality (like `===` in JavaScript)\n - `!=` or `<>` - Inequality after conversion (like `!=` in JavaScript)\n - `!==` - Strict inequality (like `!==` in JavaScript)\n\n### Helper Functions\n\nThe following functions can be used in a query:\n\n - `abs(x)` - Absolute value of `x`\n - `avg(...)` - The average of all parameters.\n - `date(d)` - Converts the argument into a date.\n - `lower(s)` - The lower-case conversion of the given string.\n - `max(...)` - The maximum value of all parameters.\n - `min(...)` - The minimum value of all parameters.\n - `sum(...)` - The sum of all parameters.\n - `upper(s)` - The upper-case conversion of the given string.\n\nThese functions are used as needed in queries, such as:\n\n     upper(name) = 'BOB'\n",

Models are explained in the\n{@link Ext.data.Model Model} docs if you're not already familiar with them.\n\nWe created the simplest type of JSON Reader possible by simply telling our\n{@link Ext.data.Store Store}'s {@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy Proxy} that we want a JSON Reader.\nThe Store automatically passes the configured model to the Store, so it is as if we passed\nthis instead:\n\n    reader: {\n        type: 'json',\n        model: 'User'\n    }\n\nThe reader we set up is ready to read data from our server - at the moment it will accept\na response like this:\n\n    [\n        {\n            \"id\": 1,\n            \"name\": \"Ed Spencer\",\n            \"email\": \"ed@sencha.com\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 2,\n            \"name\": \"Abe Elias\",\n            \"email\": \"abe@sencha.com\"\n        }\n    ]\n\n## Reading other JSON formats\n\nIf you already have your JSON format defined and it doesn't look quite like what we have above,\nyou can usually pass JsonReader a couple of configuration options to make it parse your format.\nFor example, we can use the {@link #cfg-rootProperty} configuration to parse data that comes back\nlike this:\n\n    {\n        \"users\": [\n           {\n               \"id\": 1,\n               \"name\": \"Ed Spencer\",\n               \"email\": \"ed@sencha.com\"\n           },\n           {\n               \"id\": 2,\n               \"name\": \"Abe Elias\",\n               \"email\": \"abe@sencha.com\"\n           }\n        ]\n    }\n\nTo parse this we just pass in a {@link #rootProperty} configuration that matches the 'users'\nabove:\n\n    reader: {\n        type: 'json',\n        rootProperty: 'users'\n    }\n\nSometimes the JSON structure is even more complicated. Document databases like CouchDB often\nprovide metadata around each record inside a nested structure like this:\n\n    {\n        \"total\": 122,\n        \"offset\": 0,\n        \"users\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"ed-spencer-1\",\n                \"value\": 1,\n                \"user\": {\n                    \"id\": 1,\n                    \"name\": \"Ed Spencer\",\n                    \"email\": \"ed@sencha.com\"\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n\nIn the case above the record data is nested an additional level inside the \"users\" array as each\n\"user\" item has additional metadata surrounding it ('id' and 'value' in this case). To parse\ndata out of each \"user\" item in the JSON above we need to specify the {@link #record}\nconfiguration like this:\n\n    reader: {\n        type: 'json',\n        rootProperty: 'users',\n        record: 'user'\n    }\n\n## Response MetaData\n\nThe server can return metadata in its response, in addition to the record data, that describe\nattributes of the data set itself or are used to reconfigure the Reader. To pass metadata\nin the response you simply add a `{@link #property!metaData metaData}` attribute to the root of the response data.\nThe metaData attribute can contain anything, but supports a specific set of properties\nthat are handled by the Reader if they are present:\n\n- {@link #rootProperty}: the property name of the root response node containing the record data\n- {@link #totalProperty}: property name for the total number of records in the data\n- {@link #successProperty}: property name for the success status of the response\n- {@link #messageProperty}: property name for an optional response message\n- {@link Ext.data.Model#cfg-fields fields}: Config used to reconfigure the Model's fields\n  before converting the response data into records\n\nAn initial Reader configuration containing all of these properties might look like this\n(\"fields\" would be included in the Model definition, not shown):\n\n    reader: {\n        type: 'json',\n        rootProperty: 'root',\n        totalProperty: 'total',\n        successProperty: 'success',\n        messageProperty: 'message'\n    }\n\nIf you were to pass a response object containing attributes different from those initially\ndefined above, you could use the `{@link #property!metaData metaData}` attribute to reconfigure the Reader on the fly.\nFor example:\n\n    {\n        \"count\": 1,\n        \"ok\": true,\n        \"msg\": \"Users found\",\n        \"users\": [{\n            \"userId\": 123,\n            \"name\": \"Ed Spencer\",\n            \"email\": \"ed@sencha.com\"\n        }],\n        \"metaData\": {\n            \"rootProperty\": \"users\",\n            \"totalProperty\": 'count',\n            \"successProperty\": 'ok',\n            \"messageProperty\": 'msg'\n        }\n    }\n\nYou can also place any other arbitrary data you need into the `{@link #property!metaData metaData}` attribute which will be\nignored by the Reader, but will be accessible via the Reader's {@link #metaData} property\n(which is also passed to listeners via the Proxy's\n{@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy#metachange metachange} event (also relayed by the store).\nApplication code can then process the passed metadata in any way it chooses.\n\nA simple example for how this can be used would be customizing the fields for a Model that is\nbound to a grid. By passing the `fields` property the Model will be automatically updated by the\nReader internally, but that change will not be reflected automatically in the grid unless you\nalso update the column configuration. You could do this manually, or you could simply pass\na standard grid {@link Ext.panel.Table#columns column} config object as part of the `{@link #property!metaData metaData}`\nattribute and then pass that along to the grid. Here's a very simple example for how that\ncould be accomplished:\n\n    // response format:\n    {\n        ...\n        \"metaData\": {\n            \"fields\": [\n                { \"name\": \"userId\", \"type\": \"int\" },\n                { \"name\": \"name\", \"type\": \"string\" },\n                { \"name\": \"birthday\", \"type\": \"date\", \"dateFormat\": \"Y-j-m\" },\n            ],\n            \"columns\": [\n                { \"text\": \"User ID\", \"dataIndex\": \"userId\", \"width\": 40 },\n                { \"text\": \"User Name\", \"dataIndex\": \"name\", \"flex\": 1 },\n                { \"text\": \"Birthday\", \"dataIndex\": \"birthday\", \"flex\": 1,\n                  \"format\": 'Y-j-m', \"xtype\": \"datecolumn\" }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n\nThe Reader will automatically read the meta fields config and rebuild the Model based on the new\nfields, but to handle the new column configuration you would need to handle the metadata within\nthe application code. This is done simply enough by handling the metachange event on either\nthe store or the proxy, e.g.:\n\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        ...\n        listeners: {\n            'metachange': function(store, meta) {\n                myGrid.reconfigure(store, meta.columns);\n            }\n        }\n    });\n",

Below is an example\ndemonstrating the flexibility of these associations in a fictional CRM system which manages\na User, their Orders, OrderItems and Products. First we'll define the models:\n\n    Ext.define(\"User\", {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            'id', 'name'\n        ],\n\n        hasMany: {model: 'Order', name: 'orders'},\n\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'rest',\n            url : 'users.json',\n            reader: {\n                type: 'json',\n                rootProperty: 'users'\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.define(\"Order\", {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            'id', 'total'\n        ],\n\n        hasMany  : {model: 'OrderItem', name: 'orderItems', associationKey: 'order_items'},\n        belongsTo: 'User'\n    });\n\n    Ext.define(\"OrderItem\", {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            'id', 'price', 'quantity', 'order_id', 'product_id'\n        ],\n\n        belongsTo: ['Order', {model: 'Product', associationKey: 'product'}]\n    });\n\n    Ext.define(\"Product\", {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [\n            'id', 'name'\n        ],\n\n        hasMany: 'OrderItem'\n    });\n\nThis may be a lot to take in - basically a User has many Orders, each of which is composed of\nseveral OrderItems. Finally, each OrderItem has a single Product. This allows us to consume data\nlike this:\n\n    {\n        \"users\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": 123,\n                \"name\": \"Ed\",\n                \"orders\": [\n                    {\n                        \"id\": 50,\n                        \"total\": 100,\n                        \"order_items\": [\n                            {\n                                \"id\": 20,\n                                \"price\": 40,\n                                \"quantity\": 2,\n                                \"product\": {\n                                    \"id\": 1000,\n                                    \"name\": \"MacBook Pro\"\n                                }\n                            },\n                            {\n                                \"id\": 21,\n                                \"price\": 20,\n                                \"quantity\": 3,\n                                \"product\": {\n                                    \"id\": 1001,\n                                    \"name\": \"iPhone\"\n                                }\n                            }\n                        ]\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n\nThe JSON response is deeply nested - it returns all Users (in this case just 1 for simplicity's\nsake), all of the Orders for each User (again just 1 in this case), all of the OrderItems\nfor each Order (2 order items in this case), and finally the Product associated with each\nOrderItem. Now we can read the data and use it as follows:\n\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: \"User\"\n    });\n\n    store.load({\n        callback: function() {\n            // the user that was loaded\n            var user = store.first();\n\n            console.log(\"Orders for \" + user.get('name') + \":\")\n\n            // iterate over the Orders for each User\n            user.orders().each(function(order) {\n                console.log(\"Order ID: \" + order.getId() + \", which contains items:\");\n\n                // iterate over the OrderItems for each Order\n                order.orderItems().each(function(orderItem) {\n                    // we know that the Product data is already loaded,\n                    // so we can use the synchronous getProduct\n                    // usually, we would use the asynchronous version (see #belongsTo)\n                    var product = orderItem.getProduct();\n\n                    console.log(orderItem.get('quantity') + ' orders of ' + product.get('name'));\n                });\n            });\n        }\n    });\n\nRunning the code above results in the following:\n\n    Orders for Ed:\n    Order ID: 50, which contains items:\n    2 orders of MacBook Pro\n    3 orders of iPhone\n",

Models are explained in the\n{@link Ext.data.Model Model} docs if you're not already familiar with them.\n\nWe created the simplest type of XML Reader possible by simply telling our\n{@link Ext.data.Store Store}'s {@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy Proxy} that we want a XML Reader.\nThe Store automatically passes the configured model to the Store, so it is as if we passed\nthis instead:\n\n    reader: {\n        type: 'xml',\n        model: 'User',\n        record: 'user',\n        rootProperty: 'users'\n    }\n\nThe reader we set up is ready to read data from our server - at the moment it will accept\na response like this:\n\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <users>\n        <user>\n            <id>1</id>\n            <name>Ed Spencer</name>\n            <email>ed@sencha.com</email>\n        </user>\n        <user>\n            <id>2</id>\n            <name>Abe Elias</name>\n            <email>abe@sencha.com</email>\n        </user>\n    </users>\n\nFirst off there's {@link #rootProperty} option to define the root node `<users>` (there should be\nonly one in a well-formed XML document). Then the XML Reader uses the configured {@link #record}\noption to pull out the data for each record - in this case we set record to 'user', so each\n`<user>` above will be converted into a User model.\n\nNote that XmlReader doesn't care whether your {@link #rootProperty} and {@link #record} elements\nare nested deep inside a larger structure, so a response like this will still work:\n\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <deeply>\n        <nested>\n            <xml>\n                <users>\n                    <user>\n                        <id>1</id>\n                        <name>Ed Spencer</name>\n                        <email>ed@sencha.com</email>\n                    </user>\n                    <user>\n                        <id>2</id>\n                        <name>Abe Elias</name>\n                        <email>abe@sencha.com</email>\n                    </user>\n                </users>\n            </xml>\n        </nested>\n    </deeply>\n\nIf this Reader is being used by a {@link Ext.data.TreeStore TreeStore} to read tree-structured\ndata in which records are nested as descendant nodes of other records, then this lenient\nbehaviour must be overridden by using a more specific child node selector as your {@link #record}\nselector which will not select all descendants, such as:\n\n    record: '>user'\n\n# Response metadata\n\nThe server can return additional data in its response, such as the {@link #totalProperty total\nnumber of records} and the {@link #successProperty success status of the response}. These are\ntypically included in the XML response like this:\n\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <users>\n        <total>100</total>\n        <success>true</success>\n        <user>\n            <id>1</id>\n            <name>Ed Spencer</name>\n            <email>ed@sencha.com</email>\n        </user>\n        <user>\n            <id>2</id>\n            <name>Abe Elias</name>\n            <email>abe@sencha.com</email>\n        </user>\n    </users>\n\nIf these properties are present in the XML response they can be parsed out by the XmlReader\nand used by the Store that loaded it. We can set up the names of these properties by specifying\na final pair of configuration options:\n\n    reader: {\n        type: 'xml',\n        rootProperty: 'users',\n        totalProperty: 'total',\n        successProperty: 'success'\n    }\n\nThese final options are not necessary to make the Reader work, but can be useful when the server\nneeds to report an error or if it needs to indicate that there is a lot of data available\nof which only a subset is currently being returned.\n\n# Response format\n\n**Note:** in order for the browser to parse a returned XML document, the Content-Type header\nin the HTTP response must be set to \"text/xml\" or \"application/xml\". This is very important -\nthe XmlReader will not work correctly otherwise.\n",

        "doc": "**This class is never created directly. It should be constructed through associations\nin `{@link Ext.data.Model}`.**\n\nAssociations enable you to express relationships between different {@link Ext.data.Model Models}.\nConsider an ecommerce system where Users can place Orders - there is a one to many relationship\nbetween these Models, one user can have many orders (including 0 orders). Here is what a sample\nimplementation of this association could look like. This example will be referred to in the\nfollowing sections.\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'id',\n            type: 'int'\n        }, 'name']\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('Order', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'id',\n            type: 'int'\n        }, {\n            name: 'userId',\n            type: 'int',\n            reference: 'User'\n        }]\n    });\n\n# Association Types\n\nAssocations can describe relationships in 3 ways:\n\n## Many To One\n\nA single entity (`A`) has a relationship with many (`B`) entities. An example of this is\nan ecommerce system `User` can have many `Order` entities.\n\nThis can be defined using `{@link Ext.data.schema.ManyToOne}` for keyed associations, or\n`{@link Ext.data.schema.HasMany}` for keyless associations.\n\n## One To One\n\nA less common form of Many To One, a single entity (`A`) has a relationship with at most 1 entity\n(`B`). This is often used when partitioning data. For example a `User` may have a single\n`UserInfo` object that stores extra metadata about the user.\n\nThis can be defined using `{@link Ext.data.schema.OneToOne}` for keyed associations, or\n`{@link Ext.data.schema.HasOne}` for keyless associations.\n\n## Many To Many\n\nAn entity (`A`) may have a have a relationship with many (`B`) entities. That (`B`) entity may\nalso have a relationship with many `A` entities. For example a single `Student` can have many\n`Subject` entities and a single `Subject` can have many `Student` entities.\n\nThis can be defined using `{@link Ext.data.schema.ManyToMany}`. Many To Many relationships are read-only\nunless used with a `{@link Ext.data.Session}`.\n\n\n# Keyed vs Keyless Associations\n\nAssociations can be declared in 2 ways, which are outlined below.\n\n## Keyed associations\n\nA keyed association relies on a field in the model matching the id of another model. Membership\nis driven by the key. This is the type of relationship that is typically used in a relational\ndatabase. This is declared using the ||reference|| configuration on a model field. An example\nof this can be seen  above for `User/Order`.\n\n# Keyless associations\n\nA keyless association relies on data hierarchy to determine membership. Items are members because\nthey are contained by another entity. This type of relationship is common with NoSQL databases.\nformats. A simple example definition using `User/Order`:\n\n    Ext.define('User', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'id',\n            type: 'int'\n        }, 'name'],\n        hasMany: 'Order'\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('Order', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'id',\n            type: 'int'\n        }]\n    });\n\n# Advantages of Associations\n\nAssocations make it easier to work with Models that share a connection. Some of the main\nfunctionality includes:\n\n## Generated Accessors/Setters\n\nAssociated models will automatically generate named methods that allow for accessing the\nassociated data. The names for these are created using a {@link Ext.data.schema.Schema Schema},\nto provide a consistent and predictable naming structure.\n\nUsing the example code above, there will be 3 generated methods:\n+ `User` will have an `orders()` function that returns a `{@link Ext.data.Store}` of`Orders`.\n+ `Order` will have a `getUser` method which will return a `User` Model.\n+ `Order` will have a `setUser` method that will accept a `User` model or a key value.\n\n## Nested Loading\n\nNested loading is the ability to load hierarchical associated data from a remote source within\na single request. In the following example, each `User` in the `users` store has an `orders`\nstore. Each `orders` store is populated with `Order` models read from the request. Each `Order`\nmodel also has a reference back to the appropriate `User`.\n\n    // Sample JSON data returned by /Users\n    [{\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"name\": \"User Foo\",\n        \"orders\": [{\n            \"id\": 101,\n            \"userId\": 1\n        }, {\n            \"id\": 102,\n            \"userId\": 1\n        }, {\n            \"id\": 103,\n            \"userId\": 1\n        }]\n    }, {\n        \"id\": 2,\n        \"name\": \"User Bar\",\n        \"orders\": [{\n            \"id\": 201,\n            \"userId\": 2\n        }, {\n            \"id\": 202,\n            \"userId\": 2\n        }]\n    }]\n\n    // Application code\n    var users = new Ext.data.Store({\n        model: 'User',\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'ajax',\n            url: '/Users'\n        }\n    });\n    users.load(function() {\n        var user1 = users.first(),\n            user2 = users.last(),\n            orders1 = user1.orders(),\n            orders2 = user2.orders();\n\n        // 3 orders, same reference back to user1\n        console.log(orders1.getCount(), orders1.first().getUser() === user1);\n        // 2 orders, same reference back to user2\n        console.log(orders2.getCount(), orders2.first().getUser() === user2);\n    });\n\n## Binding\n\nData binding using {@link Ext.app.ViewModel ViewModels} have functionality to be able\nto recognize associated data as part of a bind statement. For example:\n+ `{user.orders}` binds to the orders store for a user.\n+ `{order.user.name}` binds to the name of the user taken from the order.\n\n\n# Association Concepts\n\n## Roles\n\nThe role is used to determine generated names for an association. By default, the role is\ngenerated from either the field name (in a keyed association) or the model name. This naming\nfollows a pattern defined by the `{@link Ext.data.schema.Namer}`. To change a specific instance,\nan explicit role can be specified:\n\n    Ext.define('Thread', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'title']\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('Post', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'content', {\n            name: 'threadId',\n            reference: {\n                type: 'Thread',\n                role: 'discussion',\n                inverse: 'comments'\n\n            }\n        }]\n    });\n\nIn the above example, the `Thread` will be decorated with a `comments` method that returns\nthe store. The `Post` will be decorated with `getDiscussion/setDiscussion` methods.\n\n## Generated Methods\n\nAssociations generate methods to allow reading and manipulation on associated data.\n\nOn records that have a \"to many\" relationship, a single methods that returns a `{@link Ext.data.Store}`\nis created.  See {@link #storeGetter}. On records that have a \"to one\" relationship, 2 methods\nare generated, a {@link #recordGetter getter} and a {@link #recordSetter setter}.\n\n## Reflexive\n\nAssociations are reflexive. By declaring one \"side\" of the relationship, the other is\nautomatically setup. In the example below, there is no code in the `Thread` entity regarding\nthe association, however by virtue of the declaration in post, `Thread` is decorated with the\nappropriate infrastructure to participate in the association.\n\n    Ext.define('Thread', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'title']\n    });\n\n    Ext.define('Post', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['id', 'content', {\n            name: 'threadId',\n            reference: 'Thread'\n        }]\n    });\n\n## Naming\n\nReferring to model names in associations depends on their {@link Ext.data.Model#entityName}. See\nthe \"Relative Naming\" section in the `{@link Ext.data.schema.Schema}` documentation.\n",

        "doc": "A Schema is a collection of related {@link Ext.data.Model entities} and their respective\n{@link Ext.data.schema.Association associations}.\n\n# Schema Instances\n\nBy default a single instance of this class is created which serves as the schema for all\nentities that do not have an explicit `{@link Ext.data.Model#cfg-schema schema}` config\neither specified or inherited. This is sufficient in most cases.\n\nWhen an entity does specify a `{@link Ext.data.Model#cfg-schema schema}`, however, that\nlooks up (or creates) an instance for that entity class which is then inherited.\n\n**Important:** All related entities *must* belong to a single schema instance in order\nto properly link up their associations.\n\n## Configuring Schemas\n\nThe best way to control the configuration of your `schema` is to define a base class for\nall of your entities and use the `{@link Ext.data.Model#cfg-schema schema}` config like\nthis:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.model.Base', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n\n         // This configures the default schema because we don't assign an \"id\":\n         schema: {\n             // configs go here\n         }\n     });\n\n**Note:** Only one explicit configuration can be applied to the default schema. In most\napplications this will not be an issue.\n\nBy using a base class for your entities you can ensure that the default schema is fully\nconfigured before declaration of your classes proceeds. This is especially helpful if\nyou need to set the `{@link #cfg!namespace namespace}` for your schema (see below).\n\n## Relative Naming\n\nWhen describing associations between entities, it is desirable to use shorthand names\nthat do not contain the common namespace portion. This is called the `entityName` as\nopposed to its class name. By default, the `entityName` is the full class name. However,\nif a namespace is used, the common portion can be discarded and we can derive a shorter name.\nIn the following code, `\"MyApp.model.Foo\"` has an `entityName` of `\"Foo\"` and the schema has\na `{@link #cfg!namespace namespace}` of \"MyApp.model\".\n\nIf you use deeper nesting for entities, you may need to set the `{@link #cfg!namespace namespace}` config to\naccount for this. For example:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.model.Base', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n\n         schema: {\n             namespace: 'MyApp.model'\n         }\n     });\n\nYour derived classes now will generate proper default `entityName` values even if they\nhave further namespaces. For example, \"MyApp.model.foo.Thing\" will produce \"foo.Thing\"\nas the `entityName` given the above as a base class.\n\n# Association Naming\n\nThere are various terms involved when describing associations. Perhaps the simplest\nexample that will clarify these terms is that of the common many-to-many association\nof User and Group.\n\n  * `entityName` - The names \"User\" and \"Group\" are the `entityName` values associated\n  with these two classes. These are derived from their full classnames (perhaps\n  something like \"App.model.User\" and \"App.model.Group\").\n\n  * `associationName` - When talking about associations, especially the many-to-many\n  variety, it is important to give them names. Associations are not owned by either of\n  the entities involved, so this name is similar to an `entityName`. In the case of\n  \"User\" and \"Group\", the default `associationName` would be \"GroupUsers\".\n\n  * `left` and `right` - Associations describe a relationship between two entities. To\n  talk about specific associations we would use the `entityName` of the parties (such\n  as \"User\" or \"Group\"). When discussing associations in the abstract, however, it is\n  very helpful to be able to talk about the entities in an association in a general way.\n  In the case of the \"GroupUsers\" association, \"User\" is said to be the `left` while\n  \"Group\" is said to be the `right`. In a many-to-many association the selection of\n  `left` and `right` is arbitrary. When a foreign-key is involved, the `left` entity\n  is the one containing the foreign-key.\n\n## Custom Naming Conventions\n\nOne of the jobs the the `Schema` is to manage name generation (such as `entityName`).\nThis job is delegated to a class called the `{@link #cfg!namer namer}`. If you need to generate names in\nother ways, you can provide a custom `{@link #cfg!namer namer}` for your classes:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.model.Base', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n\n         schema: {\n             namespace: 'MyApp.model',\n             namer: 'custom'\n         }\n     });\n\nThis will create a class using the alias \"namer.custom\". For example:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.model.CustomNamer', {\n         extend: 'Ext.data.schema.Namer',\n\n         alias: 'namer.custom',\n         ...\n     });\n\nFor details see the documentation for {@link Ext.data.schema.Namer Namer}.\n",

This often starts by loading records when requested (via\nbind - see below) and culminates when it is time to save to the server.\n\nBecause the Session tracks all records it loads, it ensures that for any given type of\nmodel, only one record exists with a given `id`. This means that all edits of that\nrecord are properly targeted at that one instance.\n\nSimilarly, when associations are loaded, the `{@link Ext.data.Store}` created to hold the\nassociated records is tracked by the Session. So all requests for the \"OrderItems\" of\na particular Order id will result in the same Store. Adding and removing items from\nthat Order then is sure to remain consistent.\n\n# Data\n\nSince the Session is managing all this data, there are several methods it provides\nto give convenient access to that data. The most important of these is `{@link #method!update update}` and\n`{@link #method!getChanges getChanges}`.\n\nThe `{@link #method!update update}` and `{@link #method!getChanges getChanges}` methods both operate on object that contains a summary\nof records and associations and different CRUD operations.\n\n## Saving\n\nThere are two basic ways to save the contents of a Session: `{@link #method!getChanges getChanges}` and\n`{@link #method!getSaveBatch getSaveBatch}`.

Internally, Store converts each of the objects we pass in\nas {@link #cfg-data} into Model instances:\n\n     Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n         model: 'User',\n         data : [\n             {firstName: 'Peter',   lastName: 'Venkman'},\n             {firstName: 'Egon',    lastName: 'Spengler'},\n             {firstName: 'Ray',     lastName: 'Stantz'},\n             {firstName: 'Winston', lastName: 'Zeddemore'}\n         ]\n     });\n\nLoading inline data using the method above is great if the data is in the correct format already\n(e.g. it doesn't need to be processed by a {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader reader}). If your inline\ndata requires processing to decode the data structure, use a\n{@link Ext.data.proxy.Memory MemoryProxy} instead (see the\n{@link Ext.data.proxy.Memory MemoryProxy} docs for an example).\n\nAdditional data can also be loaded locally using {@link #method-add}.\n\n## Dynamic Loading\n\nStores can be dynamically updated by calling the {@link #method-load} method:\n\n    store.load({\n        params: {\n            group: 3,\n            type: 'user'\n        },\n        callback: function(records, operation, success) {\n            // do something after the load finishes\n        },\n        scope: this\n    });\n\nHere a bunch of arbitrary parameters is passed along with the load request and a callback\nfunction is set up to do something after the loading is over.\n\n## Loading Nested Data\n\nApplications often need to load sets of associated data - for example a CRM system might load\na User and her Orders. Instead of issuing an AJAX request for the User and a series of additional\nAJAX requests for each Order, we can load a nested dataset and allow the Reader to automatically\npopulate the associated models. Below is a brief example, see the {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader}\nintro docs for a full explanation:\n\n     var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n         autoLoad: true,\n         model: \"User\",\n         proxy: {\n             type: 'ajax',\n             url: 'users.json',\n             reader: {\n                 type: 'json',\n                 rootProperty: 'users'\n             }\n         }\n     });\n\nWhich would consume a response like this:\n\n     {\n         \"users\": [{\n             \"id\": 1,\n             \"name\": \"Peter\",\n             \"orders\": [{\n                 \"id\": 10,\n                 \"total\": 10.76,\n                 \"status\": \"invoiced\"\n            },{\n                 \"id\": 11,\n                 \"total\": 13.45,\n                 \"status\": \"shipped\"\n            }]\n         }]\n     }\n\nSee the {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader} intro docs for a full explanation.\n\n## Filtering and Sorting\n\nStores can be sorted and filtered - in both cases either remotely or locally. The\n{@link #cfg-sorters} and {@link #cfg-filters} are held inside\n{@link Ext.util.Collection Collection} instances to make them easy to manage. Usually it is\nsufficient to either just specify sorters and filters in the Store configuration or call\n{@link #method-sort} or {@link #filter}:\n\n     var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n         model: 'User',\n         sorters: [{\n             property: 'age',\n             direction: 'DESC'\n         }, {\n             property: 'firstName',\n             direction: 'ASC'\n         }],\n\n         filters: [{\n             property: 'firstName',\n             value: /Peter/\n         }]\n     });\n\nThe new Store will keep the configured sorters and filters in the Collection instances mentioned\nabove. By default, sorting and filtering are both performed locally by the Store - see\n{@link #remoteSort} and {@link #remoteFilter} to allow the server to perform these operations\ninstead.\n\nFiltering and sorting after the Store has been instantiated is also easy. Calling {@link #filter}\nadds another filter to the Store and automatically filters the dataset (calling {@link #filter}\nwith no arguments simply re-applies all existing filters).\n\n    store.filter('eyeColor', 'Brown');\n\nChange the sorting at any time by calling {@link #method-sort}:\n\n    store.sort('height', 'ASC');\n\nNote that all existing sorters will be removed in favor of the new sorter data (if\n{@link #method-sort} is called with no arguments, the existing sorters are just reapplied\ninstead of being removed). To keep existing sorters and add new ones, just add them to the\nCollection:\n\n    store.sorters.add(new Ext.util.Sorter({\n        property : 'shoeSize',\n        direction: 'ASC'\n    }));\n\n    store.sort();\n\n## Registering with StoreManager\n\nAny Store that is instantiated with a {@link #storeId} will automatically be registered with\nthe {@link Ext.data.StoreManager StoreManager}. This makes it easy to reuse the same store\nin multiple views:\n\n    //this store can be used several times\n    Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        model: 'User',\n        storeId: 'usersStore'\n    });\n\n    new Ext.List({\n        store: 'usersStore',\n        //other config goes here\n    });\n\n    new Ext.view.View({\n        store: 'usersStore',\n        //other config goes here\n    });\n\n## Further Reading\n\nStores are backed up by an ecosystem of classes that enables their operation. To gain a full\nunderstanding of these pieces and how they fit together, see:\n\n  - {@link Ext.data.proxy.Proxy Proxy} - overview of what Proxies are and how they are used\n  - {@link Ext.data.Model Model} - the core class in the data package\n  - {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader Reader} - used by any subclass of\n    {@link Ext.data.proxy.Server ServerProxy} to read a response\n",

The standard Tree fields will also be copied onto the Model\nfor maintaining their state. These fields are listed in the {@link Ext.data.NodeInterface}\ndocumentation.\n\n# Reading Nested Data\n\nFor the tree to read nested data, the {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader} must be configured\nwith a root property, so the reader can find nested data for each node (if a root is not\nspecified, it will default to 'children'). This will tell the tree to look for any nested tree\nnodes by the same keyword, i.e., 'children'. If a root is specified in the config make sure\nthat any nested nodes with children have the same name.\n\n**Note:** Setting {@link #defaultRootProperty} accomplishes the same thing.\n\n#rootProperty as a Function\nYou can pass a function as the data reader's rootProperty when the tree's dataset has\nmixed root properties. Child nodes can then be programmatically determined at read time.\n\nFor example, the child nodes may be passed via the 'children' property\nname, though you may have a top-level root property of 'items'.\n\nSee {@link Ext.data.reader.Reader#rootProperty rootProperty} for more information.\n\n#Filtering#\nFiltering of nodes in a TreeStore is hierarchically top down by default. This means that\nif a non-leaf node does not pass the filter, then it, and all its descendants are filtered *out*\nof the store.\n\nTo reverse this, so that any node which passes the filter causes all its ancestors to be visible,\nconfigure the `TreeStore` with '{@link #cfg-filterer filterer: 'bottomup'}`\n\nYou may also programmatically filter individual tree nodes by setting their `'visible'` field.\n\nSetting this to `false` filters the node out so that it will not appear in the UI. Setting it\nto `true` filters the node in.\n\nNote that if performing several filter operations, it is best to {@link #method-suspendEvents}\non the store first, and when all nodes have been modified, {@link #method-resumeEvents} and fire\nthe {@link #event-refresh} event on the store.\n",

In this way, access to Deferred operations are divided between\nproducer (Deferred) and consumer (Promise) roles.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nIn it's most common form, a method will create and return a Promise like this:\n\n     // A method in a service class which uses a Store and returns a Promise\n     //\n     loadCompanies: function () {\n         var deferred = new Ext.Deferred(); // create the Ext.Deferred object\n\n         this.companyStore.load({\n             callback: function (records, operation, success) {\n                 if (success) {\n                     // Use \"deferred\" to drive the promise:\n                     deferred.resolve(records);\n                 }\n                 else {\n                     // Use \"deferred\" to drive the promise:\n                     deferred.reject(\"Error loading Companies.\");\n                 }\n             }\n         });\n\n         return deferred.promise;  // return the Promise to the caller\n     }\n\nYou can see this method first creates a `{@link Ext.Deferred Deferred}` object. It then\nreturns its `Promise` object for use by the caller. Finally, in the asynchronous\ncallback, it resolves the `deferred` object if the call was successful, and rejects the\n`deferred` if the call failed.\n\nWhen a Deferred's `{@link #method!resolve resolve}` method is called, it fulfills with the optionally specified\nvalue. If `{@link #method!resolve resolve}` is called with a then-able (i.e.a Function or Object with a `{@link #method!then then}`\nfunction, such as another Promise) it assimilates the then-able's result; the Deferred\nprovides its own `{@link #method!resolve resolve}` and `{@link #method!reject reject}` methods as the onFulfilled or onRejected\narguments in a call to that then-able's `{@link #method!then then}` function. If an error is thrown while\ncalling the then-able's `{@link #method!then then}` function (prior to any call back to the specified\n`{@link #method!resolve resolve}` or `{@link #method!reject reject}` methods), the Deferred rejects with that error. If a Deferred's\n`{@link #method!resolve resolve}` method is called with its own Promise, it rejects with a TypeError.\n\nWhen a Deferred's `{@link #method!reject reject}` method is called, it rejects with the optionally specified\nreason.\n\nEach time a Deferred's `{@link #method!then then}` method is called, it captures a pair of optional\nonFulfilled and onRejected callbacks and returns a Promise of the Deferred's future\nvalue as transformed by those callbacks.\n\nSee `{@link Ext.promise.Promise}` for an example of using the returned Promise.\n",

        "doc": "\n <p>The {@link Ext.direct.AmfRemotingProvider AmfRemotingProvider}\n allows making RPC calls to a Java object on a BlazeDS or ColdFusion using either the AMFX or the AMF protocols.</p>\n\n <p>The default protocol is AMFX which works on all browsers. If you choose AMF, a flash plugin might be loaded in certain browsers that do not support posting binary data to the server, e.g. Internet Explorer version 9 or less. To choose AMF, set the {@link Ext.direct.AmfRemotingProvider#binary binary} property to true.</p>\n <p>For AMFX, the server must be configured to expose the desired services via an HTTPEndpoint. For example, the following configuration snippet adds an HTTPEndpoint (AMFX endpoint) to the BlazeDS services-config.xml file:</p>\n <pre><code>\n&lt;channel-definition id=\"my-http\" class=\"mx.messaging.channels.HTTPChannel\"&gt;\n &lt;endpoint url=\"http://{server.name}:{server.port}/{context.root}/messagebroker/http\" class=\"flex.messaging.endpoints.HTTPEndpoint\"/&gt;\n&lt;/channel-definition&gt;\n </code></pre>\n\n <p>Once the HTTPEndpoint is configured, make sure the service is exposed via the channel by adding the channel (e.g. my-http) to your remoting-services.xml file.\n For example this allows services to be accessed remotely by both AMF and AMFX:</p>\n <pre><code>\n&lt;default-channels&gt;\n &lt;channel ref=\"my-amf\"/&gt;\n &lt;channel ref=\"my-http\"/&gt;\n&lt;/default-channels&gt;\n </code></pre>\n\n <p>In order to make a call, you first need to declare the API to Ext direct. The following example defines local methods to the services provided by the sample Products application provided by Adobe as part of the BlazeDS 4.x binary turnkey distribution's testdrive (Sample 5: Updating Data):</p>\n <pre><code>\n    Ext.direct.Manager.addProvider({\n        \"url\":\"/samples/messagebroker/http\", // URL for the HTTPEndpoint\n        \"type\":\"amfremoting\",\n        \"endpoint\": \"my-http\", // the name of the HTTPEndpoint channel as defined in the server's services-config.xml\n        \"actions\":{\n        \"product\":[{ // name of the destination as defined in remoting-config.xml on the server\n            \"name\":\"getProducts\", // method name of the method to call\n            \"len\":0 // number of parameters\n        },{\n            \"name\":\"add\",\n            \"len\":1\n        },{\n            \"name\":\"bad\",\n            \"len\":0\n        }]\n        }\n    });\n\n </code></pre>\n <p>You can now call the service as follows:</p>\n <pre><code>\nproduct.getProducts((function(provider, response) {\n    // do something with the response\n    console.log(\"Got \" + response.data.length + \" objects\");\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n Note that in case server methods require parameters of a specific class (e.g. flex.samples.product.Product), you should make sure the passed parameter has a field called $flexType set to the class name (in this case flex.Samples.product.Product). This is similar to the remote class alias definition in ActionScript.\n\n\n <p>The following example shows how to define a binary AMF-based call:</p>\n <pre><code>\n    Ext.direct.Manager.addProvider({\n        \"url\":\"/samples/messagebroker/amf\", // URL for the AMFEndpoint\n        \"type\":\"amfremoting\",\n        \"endpoint\": \"my-amf\", // the name of the AMFEndpoint channel as defined in the server's services-config.xml\n        \"binary\": true, // chooses AMF encoding\n        \"actions\":{\n        \"product\":[{ // name of the destination as defined in remoting-config.xml on the server\n            \"name\":\"getProducts\", // method name of the method to call\n            \"len\":0 // number of parameters\n        },{\n            \"name\":\"add\",\n            \"len\":1\n        },{\n            \"name\":\"bad\",\n            \"len\":0\n        }]\n        }\n    });\n\n </code></pre>\n <p>Calling the server is done the same way as for the AMFX-based definition.</p>\n",

The Ext.data namespace also includes classes for working\nwith Ext.data.Stores which are backed by data from an Ext Direct method.\n\n# Specification\n\nFor additional information consult the [Ext Direct Specification][1].\n\n# Providers\n\nExt Direct uses a provider architecture, where one or more providers are used\nto transport data to and from the server. There are several providers that exist\nin the core at the moment:\n\n- {@link Ext.direct.JsonProvider JsonProvider} for simple JSON operations\n- {@link Ext.direct.PollingProvider PollingProvider} for repeated requests\n- {@link Ext.direct.RemotingProvider RemotingProvider} exposes server side to the client.\n\nA provider does not need to be invoked directly, providers are added via\n{@link Ext.direct.Manager #addProvider}. RemotingProviders' API declarations\ncan also be loaded with {@link Ext.direct.Manager #loadProvider}, with\nProvider instance created automatically after successful retrieval.\n\n# Router\n\nExt Direct RemotingProviders utilize a \"router\" on the server to direct\nrequests from the client to the appropriate server-side method. Because\nthe Ext Direct API is platform-agnostic, you could completely swap out\na Java based server solution and replace it with one that uses C#\nwithout changing the client side JavaScript at all, or vice versa.\n\n# Server side events\n\nCustom events from the server may be handled by the client by adding listeners, for example:\n\n    {\"type\":\"event\",\"name\":\"message\",\"data\":\"Successfully polled at: 11:19:30 am\"}\n\n    // add a handler for a 'message' event sent by the server\n    Ext.direct.Manager.on('message', function(e){\n        out.append(String.format('<p><i>{0}</i></p>', e.data));\n        out.el.scrollTo('t', 100000, true);\n    });\n\n   [1]: http://sencha.com/products/extjs/extdirect\n",

Many events are not listed here due to the expedient rate of change across browsers.\nFor a more comprehensive list, please visit the following resources:\n\n+ [Mozilla Event Reference Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)\n+ [W3 Pointer Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/)\n+ [W3 Touch Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/)\n+ [W3 DOM 2 Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/)\n+ [W3 DOM 3 Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/)\n\n## Usage\n\n    // by id\n    var el = Ext.get(\"my-div\");\n\n    // by DOM element reference\n    var el = Ext.get(myDivElement);\n\n## Selecting Descendant Elements\n\nExt.dom.Element instances can be used to select descendant nodes using CSS selectors.\nThere are 3 methods that can be used for this purpose, each with a slightly different\ntwist:\n\n- {@link #method-query}\n- {@link #method-selectNode}\n- {@link #method-select}\n\nThese methods can accept any valid CSS selector since they all use\n[querySelectorAll](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/) under the hood. The primary\ndifference between these three methods is their return type:\n\nTo get an array of HTMLElement instances matching the selector '.foo' use the query\nmethod:\n\n    element.query('.foo');\n\nThis can easily be transformed into an array of Ext.dom.Element instances by setting\nthe `asDom` parameter to `false`:\n\n    element.query('.foo', false);\n\nIf the desired result is only the first matching HTMLElement use the selectNode method:\n\n    element.selectNode('.foo');\n\nOnce again, the dom node can be wrapped in an Ext.dom.Element by setting the `asDom`\nparameter to `false`:\n\n    element.selectNode('.foo', false);\n\nThe `select` method is used when the desired return type is a {@link\nExt.CompositeElementLite CompositeElementLite} or a {@link Ext.CompositeElement\nCompositeElement}.  These are collections of elements that can be operated on as a\ngroup using any of the methods of Ext.dom.Element.  The only difference between the two\nis that CompositeElementLite is a collection of HTMLElement instances, while\nCompositeElement is a collection of Ext.dom.Element instances.  To retrieve a\nCompositeElementLite that represents a collection of HTMLElements for selector '.foo':\n\n    element.select('.foo');\n\nFor a {@link Ext.CompositeElement CompositeElement} simply pass `true` as the\n`composite` parameter:\n\n    element.select('.foo', true);\n\nThe query selection methods can be used even if you don't have a Ext.dom.Element to\nstart with For example to select an array of all HTMLElements in the document that match the\nselector '.foo', simply wrap the document object in an Ext.dom.Element instance using\n{@link Ext#fly}:\n\n    Ext.fly(document).query('.foo');\n\n# Animations\n\nWhen an element is manipulated, by default there is no animation.\n\n    var el = Ext.get(\"my-div\");\n\n    // no animation\n    el.setWidth(100);\n\nspecified as boolean (true) for default animation effects.\n\n    // default animation\n    el.setWidth(100, true);\n\nTo configure the effects, an object literal with animation options to use as the Element\nanimation configuration object can also be specified. Note that the supported Element animation\nconfiguration options are a subset of the {@link Ext.fx.Anim} animation options specific to Fx\neffects. The supported Element animation configuration options are:\n\n    Option    Default   Description\n    --------- --------  ---------------------------------------------\n    duration  350       The duration of the animation in milliseconds\n    easing    easeOut   The easing method\n    callback  none      A function to execute when the anim completes\n    scope     this      The scope (this) of the callback function\n\nUsage:\n\n    // Element animation options object\n    var opt = {\n        duration: 1000,\n        easing: 'elasticIn',\n        callback: this.foo,\n        scope: this\n    };\n    // animation with some options set\n    el.setWidth(100, opt);\n\nThe Element animation object being used for the animation will be set on the options object\nas \"anim\", which allows you to stop or manipulate the animation. Here is an example:\n\n    // using the \"anim\" property to get the Anim object\n    if(opt.anim.isAnimated()){\n        opt.anim.stop();\n    }\n",

        "doc": "The DomHelper class provides a layer of abstraction from DOM and transparently supports creating\nelements via DOM or using HTML fragments. It also has the ability to create HTML fragment\ntemplates from your DOM building code.\n\n## DomHelper element specification object\n\nA specification object is used when creating elements. Attributes of this object are assumed\nto be element attributes, except for 4 special attributes:\n\n* **tag**: The tag name of the element\n* **children (or cn)**: An array of the same kind of element definition objects to be created\nand appended. These can be nested as deep as you want.\n* **cls**: The class attribute of the element. This will end up being either the \"class\"\nattribute on a HTML fragment or className for a DOM node, depending on whether DomHelper is using\nfragments or DOM.\n* **html**: The innerHTML for the element\n\n## Insertion methods\n\nCommonly used insertion methods:\n\n* {@link #append}\n* {@link #insertBefore}\n* {@link #insertAfter}\n* {@link #overwrite}\n* {@link #insertHtml}\n\n## Example\n\nThis is an example, where an unordered list with 3 children items is appended to an existing\nelement with id 'my-div':\n\n    var dh = Ext.DomHelper; // create shorthand alias\n    // specification object\n    var spec = {\n        id: 'my-ul',\n        tag: 'ul',\n        cls: 'my-list',\n        // append children after creating\n        children: [     // may also specify 'cn' instead of 'children'\n            {tag: 'li', id: 'item0', html: 'List Item 0'},\n            {tag: 'li', id: 'item1', html: 'List Item 1'},\n            {tag: 'li', id: 'item2', html: 'List Item 2'}\n        ]\n    };\n    var list = dh.append(\n        'my-div', // the context element 'my-div' can either be the id or the actual node\n        spec      // the specification object\n    );\n\nElement creation specification parameters in this class may also be passed as an Array\nof specification objects. This can be used to insert multiple sibling nodes into an existing\ncontainer very efficiently. For example, to add more list items to the example above:\n\n    dh.append('my-ul', [\n        {tag: 'li', id: 'item3', html: 'List Item 3'},\n        {tag: 'li', id: 'item4', html: 'List Item 4'}\n    ]);\n\n## Templating\n\nThe real power is in the built-in templating. Instead of creating or appending any elements,\ncreateTemplate returns a Template object which can be used over and over to insert new elements.\nRevisiting the example above, we could utilize templating this time:\n\n    // create the node\n    var list = dh.append('my-div', {tag: 'ul', cls: 'my-list'});\n    // get template\n    var tpl = dh.createTemplate({tag: 'li', id: 'item{0}', html: 'List Item {0}'});\n\n    for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++){\n        tpl.append(list, i); // use template to append to the actual node\n    }\n\nAn example using a template:\n\n    var html = '\"{0}\" href=\"{1}\" class=\"nav\">{2}';\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.DomHelper.createTemplate(html);\n    tpl.append('blog-roll', ['link1', 'http://www.foxmulder.com/', \"Fox's Site\"]);\n    tpl.append('blog-roll', ['link2', 'http://www.danascully.org/', \"Scully's Site\"]);\n\nThe same example using named parameters:\n\n    var html = '\"{id}\" href=\"{url}\" class=\"nav\">{text}';\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.DomHelper.createTemplate(html);\n    tpl.append('blog-roll', {\n        id: 'link1',\n        url: 'http://www.danascully.org/',\n        text: \"Scully's Site\"\n    });\n    tpl.append('blog-roll', {\n        id: 'link2',\n        url: 'http://www.foxmulder.com/',\n        text: \"Fox's Site\"\n    });\n\n## Compiling Templates\n\nTemplates are applied using regular expressions. The performance is great, but if you are adding\na bunch of DOM elements using the same template, you can increase performance even further by\n\"compiling\" the template. The way \"compile()\" works is the template is parsed and broken up\nat the different variable points and a dynamic function is created and eval'ed. The generated\nfunction performs string concatenation of these parts and the passed variables instead of using\nregular expressions.\n\n    var html = '\"{id}\" href=\"{url}\" class=\"nav\">{text}';\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.DomHelper.createTemplate(html);\n    tpl.compile();\n\n    // ... use template like normal\n\n## Performance Boost\n\nDomHelper will transparently create HTML fragments when it can. Using HTML fragments instead of\nDOM can significantly boost performance.\n\nElement creation specification parameters may also be strings which are used as innerHTML.\n",

For example, `div[@foo='bar']` is also a valid attribute selector.\n\n  - **`E[foo]`** has an attribute \"foo\"\n  - **`E[foo=bar]`** has an attribute \"foo\" that equals \"bar\"\n  - **`E[foo^=bar]`** has an attribute \"foo\" that starts with \"bar\"\n  - **`E[foo$=bar]`** has an attribute \"foo\" that ends with \"bar\"\n  - **`E[foo*=bar]`** has an attribute \"foo\" that contains the substring \"bar\"\n  - **`E[foo%=2]`** has an attribute \"foo\" that is evenly divisible by 2\n  - **`E[foo!=bar]`** attribute \"foo\" does not equal \"bar\"\n\n## Pseudo Classes:\n\n  - **`E:first-child`** E is the first child of its parent\n  - **`E:last-child`** E is the last child of its parent\n  - **`E:nth-child(_n_)`** E is the _n_th child of its parent (1 based as per the spec)\n  - **`E:nth-child(odd)`** E is an odd child of its parent\n  - **`E:nth-child(even)`** E is an even child of its parent\n  - **`E:only-child`** E is the only child of its parent\n  - **`E:checked`** E is an element that is has a checked attribute that is true (e.g. a radio or checkbox)\n  - **`E:first`** the first E in the resultset\n  - **`E:last`** the last E in the resultset\n  - **`E:nth(_n_)`** the _n_th E in the resultset (1 based)\n  - **`E:odd`** shortcut for :nth-child(odd)\n  - **`E:even`** shortcut for :nth-child(even)\n  - **`E:contains(foo)`** E's innerHTML contains the substring \"foo\"\n  - **`E:nodeValue(foo)`** E contains a textNode with a nodeValue that equals \"foo\"\n  - **`E:not(S)`** an E element that does not match simple selector S\n  - **`E:has(S)`** an E element that has a descendent that matches simple selector S\n  - **`E:next(S)`** an E element whose next sibling matches simple selector S\n  - **`E:prev(S)`** an E element whose previous sibling matches simple selector S\n  - **`E:any(S1|S2|S2)`** an E element which matches any of the simple selectors S1, S2 or S3\n  - **`E:visible(true)`** an E element which is deeply visible according to {@link Ext.dom.Element#isVisible}\n\n## CSS Value Selectors:\n\n  - **`E{display=none}`** css value \"display\" that equals \"none\"\n  - **`E{display^=none}`** css value \"display\" that starts with \"none\"\n  - **`E{display$=none}`** css value \"display\" that ends with \"none\"\n  - **`E{display*=none}`** css value \"display\" that contains the substring \"none\"\n  - **`E{display%=2}`** css value \"display\" that is evenly divisible by 2\n  - **`E{display!=none}`** css value \"display\" that does not equal \"none\"\n\n## XML Namespaces:\n  - **`ns|E`** an element with tag E and namespace prefix ns\n\n[1]: http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-css3-selectors-20051215/#selectors\n",

In the latter case, the function\nis evaluated when the data is requested.\n\nThe {@link Ext.drag.Info#getData} method may be called once the drop completes. The data for the\nrelevant type is retrieved. All values from this method return a {@link Ext.Promise} to allow\nfor consistency when dealing with synchronous and asynchronous data.\n\n## Proxy\n\nA {@link #proxy} is an element that follows the mouse cursor during a drag.

By default (without configuration), all\n{@link Ext.drag.Source sources} and targets can interact with each other, the conditions\nare evaluated in this order:\n\n### {@link #isDisabled Disabled State}\nIf the target is disabled, the {@link Ext.drag.Source source}\ncannot interact with it.\n\n### {@link #groups Groups}\nBoth the {@link Ext.drag.Source source} and target can belong to multiple groups.\nThey may interact if:\n- Neither has a group\n- Both have one (or more) of the same group\n\n### {@link #method!accepts Accept}\nThis method is called each time a {@link Ext.drag.Source source} enters this\ntarget. If the method returns `false`, the drag is not considered valid.\n\n## Asynchronous drop processing\n\n When the drop completes, the {@link #drop} event will fire, however the underlying data\nmay not be ready to be consumed. By returning a {@link Ext.Promise Promise} from the data,\nit allows either:\n- The data to be fetched (either from a remote source or generated if expensive).\n- Any validation to take place before the drop is finalized.\n\nOnce the promise is {@link Ext.Promise#resolve resolved} or {@link Ext.Promise#resolve rejected},\nfurther processing can be completed.\n\nValidation example:\n\n\n     var confirmSource = new Ext.drag.Source({\n         element: dragEl,\n         describe: function(info) {\n             // Provide the data up front\n             info.setData('records', theRecords);\n         }\n     });\n\n     var confirmTarget = new Ext.drag.Target({\n         element: dropEl,\n         listeners: {\n             drop: function(target, info) {\n                 Ext.MessageBox.confirm('Really', 'Are you sure?', function(btn) {\n                     if (btn === 'yes') {\n                         info.getData('records').then(function(data) {\n                             // Process the data\n                         });\n                     }\n                 });\n             }\n         }\n     });\n\n\nRemote data example:\n\n     var fetchSource = new Ext.drag.Source({\n         element: dragEl,\n         // The resulting drag data will be a binary blob\n         // of image data, we don't want to fetch it up front, so\n         // pass a callback to be executed when data is requested.\n         describe: function(info) {\n             info.setData('image', function() {\n                 return Ext.Ajax.request({\n                     url: 'data.json'\n                     // some options\n                 }).then(function(result) {\n                     var imageData;\n                     // Do some post-processing\n                     return imageData;\n                 }, function() {\n                     return Ext.Promise.reject('Something went wrong!');\n                 });\n             });\n         }\n     });\n\n     var fetchTarget = new Ext.drag.Target({\n         element: dropEl,\n         accepts: function(info) {\n             return info.types.indexOf('image') > -1;\n         },\n         listeners: {\n             drop: function(target, info) {\n                 info.getData('image').then(function() {\n                     // All good, show the image\n                 }, function() {\n                     // Handle failure case\n                 });\n             }\n         }\n     });\n",

        "doc": "Ext.draw.Matix is a utility class used to calculate\n[affine transformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation) matrix.\nThe matrix class is used to apply transformations to existing\n{@link Ext.draw.sprite.Sprite sprites} using a number of convenience transform\nmethods.\n\nTransformations configured directly on a sprite are processed in the following order:\nscaling, rotation, and translation.  The matrix class offers additional flexibility.\nOnce a sprite is created, you can use the matrix class's transform methods as many\ntimes as needed and in any order you choose.\n\nTo demonstrate, we'll start with a simple {@link Ext.draw.sprite.Rect rect} sprite\nwith the intent of rotating it 180 degrees with the bottom right corner being the\ncenter of rotation.  To begin, let's look at the initial, untransformed sprite:\n\n    @example\n    var drawContainer = new Ext.draw.Container({\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        width: 380,\n        height: 380,\n        sprites: [{\n            type: 'rect',\n            width: 100,\n            height: 100,\n            fillStyle: 'red'\n        }]\n    });\n\nNext, we'll use the {@link #rotate} and {@link #translate} methods from our matrix\nclass to position the rect sprite.\n\n    @example\n    var drawContainer = new Ext.draw.Container({\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        width: 380,\n        height: 380,\n        sprites: [{\n            type: 'rect',\n            width: 100,\n            height: 100,\n            fillStyle: 'red'\n        }]\n    });\n\n    var main = drawContainer.getSurface();\n    var rect = main.getItems()[0];\n\n    var m = new Ext.draw.Matrix().translate(100, 100).\n    rotate(Math.PI).\n    translate(-100, - 100);\n\n    rect.setTransform(m);\n    main.renderFrame();\n\nIn the previous example we perform the following steps in order to achieve our\ndesired rotated output:\n\n - translate the rect to the right and down by 100\n - rotate by 180 degrees\n - translate the rect to the right and down by 100\n\n**Note:** A couple of things to note at this stage; 1) the rotation center point is\nthe upper left corner of the sprite by default and 2) with transformations, the\nsprite itself isn't transformed, but rather the entire coordinate plane of the sprite\nis transformed.  The coordinate plane itself is translated by 100 and then rotated\n180 degrees.  And that is why in the third step we translate the sprite using\nnegative values.  Translating by -100 in the third step results in the sprite\nvisually moving to the right and down within the draw container.\n\nFortunately there is a shortcut we can apply using two optional params of the rotate\nmethod allowing us to specify the center point of rotation:\n\n    @example\n    var drawContainer = new Ext.draw.Container({\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        width: 380,\n        height: 380,\n        sprites: [{\n            type: 'rect',\n            width: 100,\n            height: 100,\n            fillStyle: 'red'\n        }]\n    });\n\n    var main = drawContainer.getSurface();\n    var rect = main.getItems()[0];\n\n    var m = new Ext.draw.Matrix().rotate(Math.PI, 100, 100);\n\n    rect.setTransform(m);\n    main.renderFrame();\n\n\nThis class is compatible with\n[SVGMatrix](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#InterfaceSVGMatrix) except:\n\n  1. Ext.draw.Matrix is not read only\n  2. Using Number as its values rather than floats\n\nUsing this class helps to reduce the severe numeric\n[problem with HTML Canvas and SVG transformation](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8784405/large-numbers-in-html-canvas-translate-result-in-strange-behavior)\n\nAdditionally, there's no way to get the current transformation matrix\n[in Canvas](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7395813/html5-canvas-get-transform-matrix).\n",

        "doc": "A sprite is a basic primitive from the charts package which represents a graphical\nobject that can be drawn. Sprites are used extensively in the charts package to\ncreate the visual elements of each chart.  You can also create a desired image by\nadding one or more sprites to a {@link Ext.draw.Container draw container}.\n\nThe Sprite class itself is an abstract class and is not meant to be used directly.\nThere are many different kinds of sprites available in the charts package that extend\nExt.draw.sprite.Sprite. Each sprite type has various attributes that define how that\nsprite should look. For example, this is a {@link Ext.draw.sprite.Rect rect} sprite:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'draw',\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        width: 400,\n        height: 400,\n        sprites: [{\n            type: 'rect',\n            x: 50,\n            y: 50,\n            width: 100,\n            height: 100,\n            fillStyle: '#1F6D91'\n        }]\n    });\n\nBy default, sprites are added to the default 'main' {@link Ext.draw.Surface surface}\nof the draw container.  However, sprites may also be configured with a reference to a\nspecific Ext.draw.Surface when set in the draw container's\n{@link Ext.draw.Container#cfg-sprites sprites} config.  Specifying a surface\nother than 'main' will create a surface by that name if it does not already exist.\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'draw',\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        width: 400,\n        height: 400,\n        sprites: [{\n            type: 'rect',\n            surface: 'anim',  // a surface with id \"anim\" will be created automatically\n            x: 50,\n            y: 50,\n            width: 100,\n            height: 100,\n            fillStyle: '#1F6D91'\n        }]\n    });\n\nThe ability to have multiple surfaces is useful for performance (and battery life)\nreasons. Because changes to sprite attributes cause the whole surface (and all\nsprites in it) to re-render, it makes sense to group sprites by surface, so changes\nto one group of sprites will only trigger the surface they are in to re-render.\n\nYou can add a sprite to an existing drawing by adding the sprite to a draw surface.\n\n    @example\n    var drawCt = Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'draw',\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        width: 400,\n        height: 400\n    });\n\n    // If the surface name is not specified then 'main' will be used\n    var surface = drawCt.getSurface();\n\n    surface.add({\n        type: 'rect',\n        x: 50,\n        y: 50,\n        width: 100,\n        height: 100,\n        fillStyle: '#1F6D91'\n    });\n\n    surface.renderFrame();\n\n**Note:** Changes to the sprites on a surface will be not be reflected in the DOM\nuntil you call the surface's {@link Ext.draw.Surface#method-renderFrame renderFrame}\nmethod.  This must be done after adding, removing, or modifying sprites in order to\nsee the changes on-screen.\n\nFor information on configuring a sprite with an initial transformation see\n{@link #scaling}, {@link #rotation}, and {@link #translation}.\n\nFor information on applying a transformation to an existing sprite see the\nExt.draw.Matrix class.\n",

The surface API has methods to render\nsprites, get sprite bounding boxes (dimensions), add sprites to the underlying DOM,\nand more.\n\nA surface is automatically created when a draw container is created.  By default,\nthis will be a surface with an `id` of \"main\" and will manage all sprites in the draw\ncontainer (unless the sprite configs specify a unique surface \"id\").\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'draw',\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        width: 400,\n        height: 400,\n        sprites: [{\n            type: 'rect',\n            surface: 'anim',  // a surface with id \"anim\" will be created automatically\n            x: 50,\n            y: 50,\n            width: 100,\n            height: 100,\n            fillStyle: '#1F6D91'\n        }]\n    });\n\nThe ability to have multiple surfaces is useful for performance (and battery life)\nreasons. Because changes to sprite attributes cause the whole surface (and all\nsprites in it) to re-render, it makes sense to group sprites by surface, so changes\nto one group of sprites will only trigger the surface they are in to re-render.\n\nOne of the more useful methods is the {@link #add} method used to add sprites to the\nsurface:\n\n    @example\n    var drawCt = Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'draw',\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        width: 400,\n        height: 400\n    });\n\n    // If the surface name is not specified then 'main' will be used\n    var surface = drawCt.getSurface();\n\n    surface.add({\n        type: 'rect',\n        x: 50,\n        y: 50,\n        width: 100,\n        height: 100,\n        fillStyle: '#1F6D91'\n    });\n\n    surface.renderFrame();\n\n**Note:** Changes to the sprites on a surface will be not be reflected in the DOM\nuntil you call the surface's {@link Ext.draw.Surface#method-renderFrame renderFrame}\nmethod.  This must be done after adding, removing, or modifying sprites in order to\nsee the changes on-screen.\n",

Instead use `Ext.onReady`:\n\n     Ext.onReady(function () {\n         // DOM and Framework are ready...\n     });\n\n## DOM Ready\n\nThe lowest-level of readiness is DOM readiness. This level implies only that the document\nbody exists. Many things require the DOM to be ready for manipulation. If that is all\nthat is required, the `Ext.onDocumentReady` method can be called to register a callback\nto be called as soon as the DOM is ready:\n\n     Ext.onDocumentReady(function () {\n         // the document body is ready\n     });\n\n## Framework Ready\n\nIn production builds of applications it is common to have all of the code loaded before\nDOM ready, so the need to wait for \"onReady\" is often confused with only that concern.\nThis is easy to understand, at least in part because historically `Ext.onReady` only\nwaited for DOM ready.\n\nWith the introduction of `{@link Ext.Loader}`, however, it became common for DOM ready to occur\nin the middle of dynamically loading code. If application code were executed at that\ntime, any use of the yet-to-be-loaded classes would throw errors. As a consequence of\nthis, the `Ext.onReady` mechanism was extended to wait for both DOM ready *and* all of\nthe required classes to be loaded.\n\nWhen the framework enters or leaves a state where it is not ready (for example, the\nfirst dynamic load is requested or last load completes), `{@link Ext.env.Ready}` is informed.\nFor example:\n\n     Ext.env.Ready.block();\n\n     //...\n\n     Ext.env.Ready.unblock();\n\nWhen there are no blocks and the DOM is ready, the Framework is ready and the \"onReady\"\ncallbacks are called.\n\nPriority can be used to control the ordering of onReady listeners, for example:\n\n    Ext.onReady(function() {\n\n    }, null, {\n        priority: 100\n    });\n\nReady listeners with higher priorities will run sooner than those with lower priorities,\nthe default priority being `0`.  Internally the framework reserves priorities of 1000\nor greater, and -1000 or lesser for onReady handlers that must run before or after\nany application code.  Applications should stick to using priorities in the -999 - 999\nrange. The following priorities are currently in use by the framework:\n\n- Element_scroll rtl override: `1001`\n- Event system initialization: `2000`\n- Ext.dom.Element: `1500`\n",

When you use Ext.Error to {@link #raise} an error from within any class that\nuses the Class System, the Error class can automatically add the source class and method from which\nthe error was raised. It also includes logic to automatically log the error to the console, if available,\nwith additional metadata about the error. In all cases, the error will always be thrown at the end so that\nexecution will halt.\n\nExt.Error also offers a global error {@link #handle handling} method that can be overridden in order to\nhandle application-wide errors in a single spot. You can optionally {@link #ignore} errors altogether,\nalthough in a real application it's usually a better idea to override the handling function and perform\nlogging or some other method of reporting the errors in a way that is meaningful to the application.\n\nAt its simplest you can simply raise an error as a simple string from within any code:\n\nExample usage:\n\n    Ext.raise('Something bad happened!');\n\nIf raised from plain JavaScript code, the error will be logged to the console (if available) and the message\ndisplayed. In most cases however you'll be raising errors from within a class, and it may often be useful to add\nadditional metadata about the error being raised.  The {@link #raise} method can also take a config object.\nIn this form the `msg` attribute becomes the error description, and any other data added to the config gets\nadded to the error object and, if the console is available, logged to the console for inspection.\n\nExample usage:\n\n    Ext.define('Ext.Foo', {\n        doSomething: function(option){\n            if (someCondition === false) {\n                Ext.raise({\n                    msg: 'You cannot do that!',\n                    option: option,   // whatever was passed into the method\n                    'error code': 100 // other arbitrary info\n                });\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nIf a console is available (that supports the `console.dir` function) you'll see console output like:\n\n    An error was raised with the following data:\n    option:         Object { foo: \"bar\"}\n        foo:        \"bar\"\n    error code:     100\n    msg:            \"You cannot do that!\"\n    sourceClass:   \"Ext.Foo\"\n    sourceMethod:  \"doSomething\"\n\n    uncaught exception: You cannot do that!\n\nAs you can see, the error will report exactly where it was raised and will include as much information as the\nraising code can usefully provide.\n\nIf you want to handle all application errors globally you can simply override the static {@link #handle} method\nand provide whatever handling logic you need. If the method returns true then the error is considered handled\nand will not be thrown to the browser. If anything but true is returned then the error will be thrown normally.\n\nExample usage:\n\n    Ext.Error.handle = function(err) {\n        if (err.someProperty == 'NotReallyAnError') {\n            // maybe log something to the application here if applicable\n            return true;\n        }\n        // any non-true return value (including none) will cause the error to be thrown\n    }\n",

These are useful\nfor determining if a specific key was pressed, and are available both on instances,\nand as static properties of the class.  The following two statements are equivalent:\n\n    if (e.getKey() === Ext.event.Event.TAB) {\n        // tab key was pressed\n    }\n\n    if (e.getKey() === e.TAB) {\n        // tab key was pressed\n    }\n",

If you're using file uploads you should read the method\ndescription.\n\n## Example usage:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        title: 'Basic Form',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        bodyPadding: 5,\n        width: 350,\n\n        // Any configuration items here will be automatically passed along to\n        // the Ext.form.Basic instance when it gets created.\n\n        // The form will submit an AJAX request to this URL when submitted\n        url: 'save-form.php',\n\n        items: [{\n            xtype: 'textfield',\n            fieldLabel: 'Field',\n            name: 'theField'\n        }],\n\n        buttons: [{\n            text: 'Submit',\n            handler: function() {\n                // The getForm() method returns the Ext.form.Basic instance:\n                var form = this.up('form').getForm();\n                if (form.isValid()) {\n                    // Submit the Ajax request and handle the response\n                    form.submit({\n                        success: function(form, action) {\n                           Ext.Msg.alert('Success', action.result.message);\n                        },\n                        failure: function(form, action) {\n                            Ext.Msg.alert(\n                                'Failed',\n                                action.result ? action.result.message : 'No response'\n                            );\n                        }\n                    });\n                }\n            }\n        }]\n    });\n",

However\nif you are implementing a custom form field, using this as the parent class is recommended.\n\n# Values and Conversions\n\nBecause Base implements the Field mixin, it has a main value that can be initialized with the\n{@link #value} config and manipulated via the {@link #getValue} and {@link #setValue} methods.\nThis main value can be one of many data types appropriate to the current field, for instance a\n{@link Ext.form.field.Date Date} field would use a JavaScript Date object as its value type.\nHowever, because the field is rendered as a HTML input, this value data type can not always\nbe directly used in the rendered field.\n\nTherefore Base introduces the concept of a \"raw value\". This is the value of the rendered HTML\ninput field, and is normally a String. The {@link #getRawValue} and {@link #setRawValue} methods\ncan be used to directly work with the raw value, though it is recommended to use getValue\nand setValue in most cases.\n\nConversion back and forth between the main value and the raw value is handled by the\n{@link #valueToRaw} and {@link #rawToValue} methods. If you are implementing a subclass\nthat uses a non-String value data type, you should override these methods to handle\nthe conversion.\n\n# Rendering\n\nThe content of the field body is defined by the {@link #fieldSubTpl} XTemplate, with its argument\ndata created by the {@link #getSubTplData} method.

If not specified, the value `{@link #method!on on}` will be used.\n\n## Example usage\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        bodyPadding: 10,\n        width: 300,\n        title: 'Pizza Order',\n        items: [\n            {\n                xtype: 'fieldcontainer',\n                fieldLabel: 'Toppings',\n                defaultType: 'checkboxfield',\n                items: [\n                    {\n                        boxLabel  : 'Anchovies',\n                        name      : 'topping',\n                        inputValue: '1',\n                        id        : 'checkbox1'\n                    }, {\n                        boxLabel  : 'Artichoke Hearts',\n                        name      : 'topping',\n                        inputValue: '2',\n                        checked   : true,\n                        id        : 'checkbox2'\n                    }, {\n                        boxLabel  : 'Bacon',\n                        name      : 'topping',\n                        inputValue: '3',\n                        id        : 'checkbox3'\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ],\n        bbar: [\n            {\n                text: 'Select Bacon',\n                handler: function() {\n                    Ext.getCmp('checkbox3').setValue(true);\n                }\n            },\n            '-',\n            {\n                text: 'Select All',\n                handler: function() {\n                    Ext.getCmp('checkbox1').setValue(true);\n                    Ext.getCmp('checkbox2').setValue(true);\n                    Ext.getCmp('checkbox3').setValue(true);\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                text: 'Deselect All',\n                handler: function() {\n                    Ext.getCmp('checkbox1').setValue(false);\n                    Ext.getCmp('checkbox2').setValue(false);\n                    Ext.getCmp('checkbox3').setValue(false);\n                }\n            }\n        ],\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n",

The data items in the store are mapped to each option's displayed text and backing value\nvia the {@link #valueField} and {@link #displayField} configurations, respectively.\n\nIf your store is not remote, i.e. it depends only on local data and is loaded up front,\nyou should be sure to set the {@link #queryMode} to `'local'`, as this will improve\nresponsiveness for the user.\n\n# Example usage:\n\n    @example\n    // The data store containing the list of states\n    var states = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        fields: ['abbr', 'name'],\n        data : [\n            {\"abbr\":\"AL\", \"name\":\"Alabama\"},\n            {\"abbr\":\"AK\", \"name\":\"Alaska\"},\n            {\"abbr\":\"AZ\", \"name\":\"Arizona\"}\n        ]\n    });\n\n    // Create the combo box, attached to the states data store\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.ComboBox', {\n        fieldLabel: 'Choose State',\n        store: states,\n        queryMode: 'local',\n        displayField: 'name',\n        valueField: 'abbr',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\n# Events\n\nTo do something when something in ComboBox is selected, configure the select event:\n\n    var cb = Ext.create('Ext.form.ComboBox', {\n        // all of your config options\n        listeners:{\n             scope: yourScope,\n             'select': yourFunction\n        }\n    });\n\n    // Alternatively, you can assign events after the object is created:\n    var cb = new Ext.form.field.ComboBox(yourOptions);\n    cb.on('select', yourFunction, yourScope);\n\n# Multiple Selection\nThe {@link #multiSelect} config is deprecated.  For multiple selection use\n{@link Ext.form.field.Tag} or {@link Ext.view.MultiSelector}.\n\n# Filtered Stores\n\nIf you have a local store that is already filtered, you can use the {@link #lastQuery}\nconfig option to prevent the store from having the filter being cleared on first expand.\n\n## Customized combobox\n\nBoth the text shown in dropdown menu and text field can be easily customized:\n\n    @example\n    var states = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        fields: ['abbr', 'name'],\n        data : [\n            {\"abbr\":\"AL\", \"name\":\"Alabama\"},\n            {\"abbr\":\"AK\", \"name\":\"Alaska\"},\n            {\"abbr\":\"AZ\", \"name\":\"Arizona\"}\n        ]\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.ComboBox', {\n        fieldLabel: 'Choose State',\n        store: states,\n        queryMode: 'local',\n        valueField: 'abbr',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        // Template for the dropdown menu.\n        // Note the use of the \"x-list-plain\" and \"x-boundlist-item\" class,\n        // this is required to make the items selectable.\n        tpl: Ext.create('Ext.XTemplate',\n            '<ul class=\"x-list-plain\"><tpl for=\".\">',\n                '<li role=\"option\" class=\"x-boundlist-item\">{abbr} - {name}</li>',\n            '</tpl></ul>'\n        ),\n        // template for the content inside text field\n        displayTpl: Ext.create('Ext.XTemplate',\n            '<tpl for=\".\">',\n                '{abbr} - {name}',\n            '</tpl>'\n        )\n    });\n\nSee also the {@link #listConfig} option for additional configuration of the dropdown.\n",

See the example below.\n\n# Example usage\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        title: 'On The Wall',\n        width: 300,\n        bodyPadding: 10,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        items: [{\n            xtype: 'numberfield',\n            anchor: '100%',\n            name: 'bottles',\n            fieldLabel: 'Bottles of Beer',\n            value: 99,\n            maxValue: 99,\n            minValue: 0\n        }],\n        buttons: [{\n            text: 'Take one down, pass it around',\n            handler: function() {\n                this.up('form').down('[name=bottles]').spinDown();\n            }\n        }]\n    });\n\n# Removing UI Enhancements\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        title: 'Personal Info',\n        width: 300,\n        bodyPadding: 10,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        items: [{\n            xtype: 'numberfield',\n            anchor: '100%',\n            name: 'age',\n            fieldLabel: 'Age',\n            minValue: 0, //prevents negative numbers\n\n            // Remove spinner buttons, and arrow key and mouse wheel listeners\n            hideTrigger: true,\n            keyNavEnabled: false,\n            mouseWheelEnabled: false\n        }]\n    });\n\n# Using Step\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        title: 'Step',\n        width: 300,\n        bodyPadding: 10,\n        items: [{\n            xtype: 'numberfield',\n            anchor: '100%',\n            name: 'evens',\n            fieldLabel: 'Even Numbers',\n\n            // Set step so it skips every other number\n            step: 2,\n            value: 0,\n\n            // Add change handler to force user-entered numbers to evens\n            listeners: {\n                change: function(field, value) {\n                    value = parseInt(value, 10);\n                    field.setValue(value + value % 2);\n                }\n            }\n        }]\n    });\n",

Can be used as a direct replacement for traditional text inputs,\nor as the base class for more sophisticated input controls (like {@link Ext.form.field.TextArea}\nand {@link Ext.form.field.ComboBox}). Has support for empty-field placeholder values\n(see {@link #emptyText}).\n\n# Validation\n\nThe Text field has a useful set of validations built in:\n\n- {@link #allowBlank} for making the field required\n- {@link #minLength} for requiring a minimum value length\n- {@link #maxLength} for setting a maximum value length (with {@link #enforceMaxLength} to add it\n  as the `maxlength` attribute on the input element)\n- {@link #regex} to specify a custom regular expression for validation\n\nIn addition, custom validations may be added:\n\n- {@link #vtype} specifies a virtual type implementation from {@link Ext.form.field.VTypes}\n  which can contain custom validation logic\n- {@link #validator} allows a custom arbitrary function to be called during validation\n\nThe details around how and when each of these validation options get used are described in the\ndocumentation for {@link #getErrors}.\n\nBy default, the field value is checked for validity immediately while the user is typing in the\nfield. This can be controlled with the {@link #validateOnChange}, {@link #checkChangeEvents}, and\n{@link #checkChangeBuffer} configurations. Also see the details on Form Validation in the\n{@link Ext.form.Panel} class documentation.\n\n# Masking and Character Stripping\n\nText fields can be configured with custom regular expressions to be applied to entered values\nbefore validation: see {@link #maskRe} and {@link #stripCharsRe} for details.\n\n# Example usage\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        title: 'Contact Info',\n        width: 300,\n        bodyPadding: 10,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        items: [{\n            xtype: 'textfield',\n            name: 'name',\n            fieldLabel: 'Name',\n            allowBlank: false  // requires a non-empty value\n        }, {\n            xtype: 'textfield',\n            name: 'email',\n            fieldLabel: 'Email Address',\n            vtype: 'email'  // requires value to be a valid email address format\n        }]\n    });\n\n# Custom Subclasses\n\nThis class can be extended to provide additional functionality. The example below demonstrates\ncreating a custom search field that uses the HTML5 search input type.\n\n    @example\n    // A simple subclass of Base that creates a HTML5 search field. Redirects to the\n    // searchUrl when the Enter key is pressed.\n    Ext.define('Ext.form.SearchField', {\n        extend: 'Ext.form.field.Text',\n        alias: 'widget.searchfield',\n\n        inputType: 'search',\n\n        // Config defining the search URL\n        searchUrl: 'http://www.google.com/search?q={0}',\n\n        // Add specialkey listener\n        initComponent: function() {\n            this.callParent();\n            this.on('specialkey', this.checkEnterKey, this);\n        },\n\n        // Handle enter key presses, execute the search if the field has a value\n        checkEnterKey: function(field, e) {\n            var value = this.getValue();\n            if (e.getKey() === e.ENTER && !Ext.isEmpty(value)) {\n                location.href = Ext.String.format(this.searchUrl, value);\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        title: 'Base Example',\n        bodyPadding: 5,\n        width: 250,\n\n        // Fields will be arranged vertically, stretched to full width\n        layout: 'anchor',\n        defaults: {\n            anchor: '100%'\n        },\n        items: [{\n            xtype: 'searchfield',\n            fieldLabel: 'Search',\n            name: 'query'\n        }],\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n",

This is useful for arranging a group of fields within a single item\nin a form, so that it lines up nicely with other fields.

Notice in the above example\nthat the \"title\" `childEl` is set in the `{@link #cfg!renderTpl renderTpl}` using\n**data-ref=\"title\"**.\n\nWhen using `select`, the property will be an instance of {@link Ext.CompositeElement}.\nIn all other cases, the property will be an {@link Ext.dom.Element} or `null`\nif not found.\n\nCare should be taken when using `select` or `selectNode` to find child elements.\nThe following issues should be considered:\n\n- Performance: using selectors can be 10x slower than id lookup.\n- Over-selecting: selectors are applied after the DOM elements for all children\n  have been rendered, so selectors can match elements from child components\n  (including nested versions of the same component) accidentally.\n\nThis above issues are most important when using `select` since it returns multiple\nelements.\n",

It is essentially a standard\n{@link Ext.panel.Panel} which automatically creates a {@link Ext.form.Basic BasicForm}\nfor managing any {@link Ext.form.field.Field} objects that are added as descendants of the panel.\nIt also includes conveniences for configuring and working with the BasicForm and the collection\nof Fields.\n\n# Layout\n\nBy default, FormPanel is configured with `{@link Ext.layout.container.Anchor layout:'anchor'}`\nfor the layout of its immediate child items. This can be changed to any of the supported\ncontainer layouts. The layout of sub-containers is configured in\n{@link Ext.container.Container#layout the standard way}.\n\n# BasicForm\n\nFormPanel class accepts all\nof the config options supported by the {@link Ext.form.Basic} class, and will pass them along to\nthe internal BasicForm when it is created.\n\nThe following events fired by the BasicForm will be re-fired by the FormPanel and can therefore\nbe listened for on the FormPanel itself:\n\n- {@link Ext.form.Basic#beforeaction beforeaction}\n- {@link Ext.form.Basic#actionfailed actionfailed}\n- {@link Ext.form.Basic#actioncomplete actioncomplete}\n- {@link Ext.form.Basic#validitychange validitychange}\n- {@link Ext.form.Basic#dirtychange dirtychange}\n\n# Field Defaults\n\nThe {@link #fieldDefaults} config option conveniently allows centralized configuration of default\nvalues for all fields added as descendants of the FormPanel. Any config option recognized\nby implementations of {@link Ext.form.Labelable} may be included in this object. See the\n{@link #fieldDefaults} documentation for details of how the defaults are applied.\n\n# Form Validation\n\nWith the default configuration, form fields are validated on-the-fly while the user edits\ntheir values. This can be controlled on a per-field basis (or via the {@link #fieldDefaults}\nconfig) with the field config properties {@link Ext.form.field.Field#validateOnChange} and\n{@link Ext.form.field.Base#checkChangeEvents}, and the FormPanel's config properties\n{@link #pollForChanges} and {@link #pollInterval}.\n\nAny component within the FormPanel can be configured with `formBind: true`. This will cause that\ncomponent to be automatically disabled when the form is invalid, and enabled when it is valid.\nThis is most commonly used for Button components to prevent submitting the form in an invalid\nstate, but can be used on any component type.\n\nFor more information on form validation see the following:\n\n- {@link Ext.form.field.Field#validateOnChange}\n- {@link #pollForChanges} and {@link #pollInterval}\n- {@link Ext.form.field.VTypes}\n- {@link Ext.form.Basic#doAction BasicForm.doAction clientValidation notes}\n\n# Form Submission\n\nBy default, Ext Forms are submitted through Ajax, using {@link Ext.form.action.Action}.\nSee the documentation for {@link Ext.form.Basic} for details.\n\n# Example usage\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        title: 'Simple Form',\n        bodyPadding: 5,\n        width: 350,\n\n        // The form will submit an AJAX request to this URL when submitted\n        url: 'save-form.php',\n\n        // Fields will be arranged vertically, stretched to full width\n        layout: 'anchor',\n        defaults: {\n            anchor: '100%'\n        },\n\n        // The fields\n        defaultType: 'textfield',\n        items: [{\n            fieldLabel: 'First Name',\n            name: 'first',\n            allowBlank: false\n        },{\n            fieldLabel: 'Last Name',\n            name: 'last',\n            allowBlank: false\n        }],\n\n        // Reset and Submit buttons\n        buttons: [{\n            text: 'Reset',\n            handler: function() {\n                this.up('form').getForm().reset();\n            }\n        }, {\n            text: 'Submit',\n            formBind: true, //only enabled once the form is valid\n            disabled: true,\n            handler: function() {\n                var form = this.up('form').getForm();\n                if (form.isValid()) {\n                    form.submit({\n                        success: function(form, action) {\n                           Ext.Msg.alert('Success', action.result.msg);\n                        },\n                        failure: function(form, action) {\n                            Ext.Msg.alert('Failed', action.result.msg);\n                        }\n                    });\n                }\n            }\n        }],\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n",

In that case the Radio components at any depth will\nstill be managed by the RadioGroup's validation.\n\n## Example usage\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        title: 'RadioGroup Example',\n        width: 300,\n        bodyPadding: 10,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        items:[{\n            xtype: 'radiogroup',\n            fieldLabel: 'Two Columns',\n            // Arrange radio buttons into two columns, distributed vertically\n            columns: 2,\n            vertical: true,\n            items: [\n                { boxLabel: 'Item 1', name: 'rb', inputValue: '1' },\n                { boxLabel: 'Item 2', name: 'rb', inputValue: '2', checked: true},\n                { boxLabel: 'Item 3', name: 'rb', inputValue: '3' },\n                { boxLabel: 'Item 4', name: 'rb', inputValue: '4' },\n                { boxLabel: 'Item 5', name: 'rb', inputValue: '5' },\n                { boxLabel: 'Item 6', name: 'rb', inputValue: '6' }\n            ]\n        }]\n    });\n\n## Example with value binding to the RadioGroup.  In the below example, \"Item 2\" will\ninitially be checked using `myValue: '2'` from the ViewModel.\n\n    @example\n    Ext.define('MyApp.main.view.Main', {\n        extend: 'Ext.app.ViewModel',\n        alias: 'viewmodel.main',\n        data: {\n            myValue: '2'\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        title: 'RadioGroup Example',\n        viewModel: {\n            type: 'main'\n        },\n        width: 300,\n        bodyPadding: 10,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        items:[{\n            xtype: 'radiogroup',\n            fieldLabel: 'Two Columns',\n            // Arrange radio buttons into two columns, distributed vertically\n            columns: 2,\n            vertical: true,\n            simpleValue: true,  // set simpleValue to true to enable value binding\n            bind: '{myValue}',\n            items: [\n                { boxLabel: 'Item 1', name: 'rb', inputValue: '1' },\n                { boxLabel: 'Item 2', name: 'rb', inputValue: '2' },\n                { boxLabel: 'Item 3', name: 'rb', inputValue: '3' },\n                { boxLabel: 'Item 4', name: 'rb', inputValue: '4' },\n                { boxLabel: 'Item 5', name: 'rb', inputValue: '5' },\n                { boxLabel: 'Item 6', name: 'rb', inputValue: '6' }\n            ]\n        }]\n    });\n",

A key frame is a point in a particular animation. We represent this as a percentage\nof the total animation duration. At each key frame, we can specify the target values at that\ntime. Note that you *must* specify the values at 0% and 100%, the start and ending values.\nThere is also a {@link #keyframe} event that fires after each key frame is reached.\n\n## Example\n\nIn the example below, we modify the values of the element at each fifth throughout the animation.\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.fx.Animator', {\n        target: Ext.getBody().createChild({\n            style: {\n                width: '100px',\n                height: '100px',\n                'background-color': 'red'\n            }\n        }),\n        duration: 10000, // 10 seconds\n        keyframes: {\n            0: {\n                opacity: 1,\n                backgroundColor: 'FF0000'\n            },\n            20: {\n                x: 30,\n                opacity: 0.5\n            },\n            40: {\n                x: 130,\n                backgroundColor: '0000FF'\n            },\n            60: {\n                y: 80,\n                opacity: 0.3\n            },\n            80: {\n                width: 200,\n                y: 200\n            },\n            100: {\n                opacity: 1,\n                backgroundColor: '00FF00'\n            }\n        }\n    });\n",

In general, this class will not be created directly, rather\nan array of column configurations will be passed to the grid:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        storeId:'employeeStore',\n        fields:['firstname', 'lastname', 'seniority', 'dep', 'hired'],\n        data:[\n            {firstname:\"Michael\", lastname:\"Scott\", seniority:7, dep:\"Management\", hired:\"01/10/2004\"},\n            {firstname:\"Dwight\", lastname:\"Schrute\", seniority:2, dep:\"Sales\", hired:\"04/01/2004\"},\n            {firstname:\"Jim\", lastname:\"Halpert\", seniority:3, dep:\"Sales\", hired:\"02/22/2006\"},\n            {firstname:\"Kevin\", lastname:\"Malone\", seniority:4, dep:\"Accounting\", hired:\"06/10/2007\"},\n            {firstname:\"Angela\", lastname:\"Martin\", seniority:5, dep:\"Accounting\", hired:\"10/21/2008\"}\n        ]\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {\n        title: 'Column Demo',\n        store: Ext.data.StoreManager.lookup('employeeStore'),\n        columns: [\n            {text: 'First Name',  dataIndex:'firstname'},\n            {text: 'Last Name',  dataIndex:'lastname'},\n            {text: 'Hired Month',  dataIndex:'hired', xtype:'datecolumn', format:'M'},\n            {text: 'Department (Yrs)', xtype:'templatecolumn', tpl:'{dep} ({seniority})'}\n        ],\n        width: 400,\n        forceFit: true,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\n# Convenience Subclasses\n\nThere are several column subclasses that provide default rendering for various data types\n\n - {@link Ext.grid.column.Action}: Renders icons that can respond to click events inline\n - {@link Ext.grid.column.Boolean}: Renders for boolean values\n - {@link Ext.grid.column.Date}: Renders for date values\n - {@link Ext.grid.column.Number}: Renders for numeric values\n - {@link Ext.grid.column.Template}: Renders a value using an {@link Ext.XTemplate} using the record data\n\n# Setting Widths\n\nThe columns are laid out by a {@link Ext.layout.container.HBox} layout, so a column can either\nbe given an explicit width value or a {@link #flex} configuration. If no width is specified the grid will\nautomatically the size the column to 100px.\n\nGroup columns (columns with {@link #columns child columns}) may be sized using {@link #flex},\nin which case they will apply `forceFit` to their child columns so as not to leave blank space.\n\nIf a group column is not flexed, its width is calculated by measuring the width of the\nchild columns, so a width option should not be specified in that case.\n\n# Header Options\n\n - {@link #text}: Sets the header text for the column\n - {@link #sortable}: Specifies whether the column can be sorted by clicking the header or using the column menu\n - {@link #hideable}: Specifies whether the column can be hidden using the column menu\n - {@link #menuDisabled}: Disables the column header menu\n - {@link #cfg-draggable}: Specifies whether the column header can be reordered by dragging\n - {@link #groupable}: Specifies whether the grid can be grouped by the column dataIndex. See also {@link Ext.grid.feature.Grouping}\n\n# Data Options\n\n - {@link #dataIndex}: The dataIndex is the field in the underlying {@link Ext.data.Store} to use as the value for the column.\n - {@link Ext.grid.column.Column#renderer}: Allows the underlying store\n value to be transformed before being displayed in the grid\n\n## State saving\n\nWhen the owning {@link Ext.grid.Panel Grid} is configured\n{@link Ext.grid.Panel#cfg-stateful}, it will save its column state (order and width)\nencapsulated within the default Panel state of changed width and height and\ncollapsed/expanded state.\n\nOn a `{@link #cfg!stateful stateful}` grid, not only should the Grid have a\n{@link Ext.grid.Panel#cfg-stateId}, each column of the grid should also be configured\nwith a {@link #stateId} which identifies that column locally within the grid.\n\nOmitting the `{@link #cfg!stateId stateId}` config from the columns results in columns with generated\ninternal ID's.  The generated ID's are subject to change on each page load\nmaking it impossible for the state manager to restore the previous state of the\ncolumns.\n",

        "doc": "A widget column is configured with a {@link #widget} config object which specifies an\n{@link Ext.Component#cfg-xtype xtype} to indicate which type of Widget or Component belongs\nin the cells of this column.\n\nWhen a widget cell is rendered, a {@link Ext.Widget Widget} or {@link Ext.Component Component}\nof the specified type is rendered into that cell.\n\nThere are two ways of setting values in a cell widget.\n\nThe simplest way is to use data binding. To use column widget data binding, the widget must\neither contain  a top-level bind statement, which will cause a\n{@link Ext.app.ViewModel ViewModel} to be automatically injected into the widget. This ViewModel\nwill inherit data from any ViewModel that the grid is using, and it will also contain\ntwo extra properties:\n\n- `record`: {@link Ext.data.Model Model}<br>The record which backs the grid row.\n- `recordIndex`: {@link Number}<br>The index in the dataset of the record which backs\n   the grid row.\n\nFor complex widgets, where the widget may be a container that does not directly use any\ndata binding, but has items which do, the specification of a\n{@link Ext.panel.Table#rowViewModel rowViewModel} type or configuration  is required on the grid.\nThis can simply be an empty object if grid widgets only require binding to the row record.\n\nThe deprecated way is to configure the column with a {@link #dataIndex}. The widget's\n{@link Ext.Component#defaultBindProperty defaultBindProperty} will be set using the\nspecified field from the associated record.\n\nIn the example below we are monitoring the throughput of electricity substations. The capacity\nbeing used as a proportion of the maximum rated capacity is displayed as a progress bar.\nAs new data arrives and the instantaneous usage value is updated, the `capacityUsed`\nfield updates itself, and the record's change is broadcast to all bindings.\nThe {@link Ext.Progress Progress Bar Widget}'s\n{@link Ext.ProgressBarWidget#defaultBindProperty defaultBindProperty} (which is\n\"value\") is set to the calculated `capacityUsed`.\n\n    @example\n    var grid = new Ext.grid.Panel({\n        title: 'Substation power monitor',\n        width: 600,\n        viewConfig: {\n            enableTextSelection: false,\n            markDirty: false\n        },\n        columns: [{\n            text: 'Id',\n            dataIndex: 'id',\n            width: 120\n        }, {\n            text: 'Rating',\n            dataIndex: 'maxCapacity',\n            width: 80\n        }, {\n            text: 'Avg.',\n            dataIndex: 'avg',\n            width: 85,\n            formatter: 'number(\"0.00\")'\n        }, {\n            text: 'Max',\n            dataIndex: 'max',\n            width: 80\n        }, {\n            text: 'Instant',\n            dataIndex: 'instant',\n            width: 80\n        }, {\n            text: '%Capacity',\n            width: 150,\n\n            // This is our Widget column\n            xtype: 'widgetcolumn',\n\n            // This is the widget definition for each cell.\n            // The Progress widget class's defaultBindProperty is 'value'\n            // so its \"value\" setting is taken from the ViewModel's record \"capacityUsed\" field\n            // Note that a row ViewModel will automatically be injected due to the existence of\n            // the bind property in the widget configuration.\n            widget: {\n                xtype: 'progressbarwidget',\n                bind: '{record.capacityUsed}',\n                textTpl: [\n                    '{percent:number(\"0\")}% capacity'\n                ]\n            }\n        }],\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        disableSelection: true,\n        store: {\n           fields: [{\n               name: 'id',\n               type: 'string'\n           }, {\n               name: 'maxCapacity',\n               type: 'int'\n           }, {\n               name: 'avg',\n               type: 'int',\n               calculate: function(data) {\n                   // Make this depend upon the instant field being set which sets\n                   // the sampleCount and total.\n                   // Use subscript format to access the other pseudo fields\n                   //  which are set by the instant field's converter\n                   return data.instant && data['total'] / data['sampleCount'];\n               }\n           }, {\n               name: 'max',\n               type: 'int',\n               calculate: function(data) {\n                   // This will be seen to depend on the \"instant\" field.\n                   // Use subscript format to access this field's current value\n                   //  to avoid circular dependency error.\n                   return (data['max'] || 0) < data.instant ? data.instant : data['max'];\n               }\n           }, {\n               name: 'instant',\n               type: 'int',\n\n               // Upon every update of instantaneous power throughput,\n               // update the sample count and total so that the max field can calculate itself\n               convert: function(value, rec) {\n                   rec.data.sampleCount = (rec.data.sampleCount || 0) + 1;\n                   rec.data.total = (rec.data.total || 0) + value;\n                   return value;\n               },\n              depends: []\n           }, {\n               name: 'capacityUsed',\n               calculate: function(data) {\n                   return data.instant / data.maxCapacity;\n               }\n           }],\n           data: [{\n               id: 'Substation A',\n               maxCapacity: 1000,\n               avg: 770,\n               max: 950,\n               instant: 685\n           }, {\n               id: 'Substation B',\n               maxCapacity: 1000,\n               avg: 819,\n               max: 992,\n               instant: 749\n           }, {\n               id: 'Substation C',\n               maxCapacity: 1000,\n               avg: 588,\n                 max: 936,\n               instant: 833\n           }, {\n               id: 'Substation D',\n               maxCapacity: 1000,\n               avg: 639,\n               max: 917,\n               instant: 825\n           }]\n       }\n    });\n\n    // Fake data updating...\n    // Change one record per second to a random power value\n    Ext.interval(function() {\n        var recIdx = Ext.Number.randomInt(0, 3),\n            newPowerReading = Ext.Number.randomInt(500, 1000);\n\n        grid.store.getAt(recIdx).set('instant', newPowerReading);\n    }, 1000);\n",

It provides several\nhooks that allows the developer to inject additional functionality at certain points throughout\nthe grid creation cycle. This class provides the base template methods that are available\nto the developer, it should be extended.\n\nThere are several built in features that extend this class, for example:\n\n - {@link Ext.grid.feature.Grouping} - Shows grid rows in groups as specified by the\n   {@link Ext.data.Store}\n - {@link Ext.grid.feature.RowBody} - Adds a body section for each grid row that can contain\n   markup.\n - {@link Ext.grid.feature.Summary} - Adds a summary row at the bottom of the grid\n   with aggregate totals for a column.\n\n## Using Features\nA feature is added to the grid by specifying it an array of features in the configuration:\n\n    var groupingFeature = Ext.create('Ext.grid.feature.Grouping');\n    Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {\n        // other options\n        features: [groupingFeature]\n    });\n\n## Writing Features\n\nA Feature may add new DOM structure within the structure of a grid.\n\nA grid is essentially a `<table>` element. A {@link Ext.view.Table TableView} instance uses\nfour {@link Ext.XTemplate XTemplates} to render the grid, `tpl`, `itemTpl`, `rowTpl`, `cellTpl`.\n\nA {@link Ext.view.Table TableView} uses its `tpl` to emit the item encapsulating HTML tags\ninto its output stream. To render the rows, it invokes {@link Ext.view.Table#renderRows}\npassing the `rows` member of its data object and the `columns` member of its data object.\n\nThe `tpl`'s data object Looks like this:\n    {\n        view: owningTableView,\n        rows: recordsToRender,\n        viewStartIndex: indexOfFirstRecordInStore,\n        tableStyle: styleString\n    }\n\n* A {@link Ext.view.Table TableView} uses its `rowTpl` to emit a `<tr>` HTML tag to its output\nstream. To render cells, it invokes {@link Ext.view.Table#renderCell} passing the `rows` member\nof its data object.\n\nThe `itemTpl` and `rowTpl`'s data object looks like this:\n\n    {\n        view:        owningTableView,\n        record:      recordToRender,\n        recordIndex: indexOfRecordInStore,\n        rowIndex:    indexOfRowInView,\n        columns:     arrayOfColumnDefinitions,\n        itemClasses: arrayOfClassNames, // For outermost row in case of wrapping\n        rowClasses:  arrayOfClassNames,  // For internal data bearing row in case of wrapping\n        rowStyle:    styleString\n    }\n\n* A {@link Ext.view.Table TableView} uses its `cellTpl` to emit a `<td>` HTML tag to its output\nstream.\n\nThe `cellTpl's` data object looks like this:\n\n    {\n        record: recordToRender\n        column: columnToRender;\n        recordIndex: indexOfRecordInStore,\n        rowIndex:    indexOfRowInView,\n        columnIndex: columnIndex,\n        align: columnAlign,\n        tdCls: classForCell\n    }\n\nA Feature may inject its own tpl or rowTpl or cellTpl into the {@link Ext.view.Table TableView}'s\nrendering by calling {@link Ext.view.Table#addTpl} or {@link Ext.view.Table#addRowTpl} or\n{@link Ext.view.Table#addCellTpl}.\n\nThe passed XTemplate is added *upstream* of the default template for the table element in a link\nlist of XTemplates which contribute to the element's HTML. It may emit appropriate HTML strings\ninto the output stream *around* a call to\n\n    this.nextTpl.apply(values, out, parent);\n\nThis passes the current value context, output stream and the parent value context to the next\nXTemplate in the list.\n",

This can be disabled by setting the {@link #enableGroupingMenu} option.\nThe option to disallow grouping from being turned off by the user is {@link #enableNoGroups}.\n\n## Controlling Group Text\n\nThe {@link #groupHeaderTpl} is used to control the rendered title for each group. It can modified\nto customized the default display.\n\n## Groupers\n\nBy default, this feature expects that the data field that is mapped to by the\n{@link Ext.data.AbstractStore#groupField} config is a simple data type such as a\nString or a Boolean. However, if you intend to group by a data field that is a\ncomplex data type such as an Object or Array, it is necessary to define one or more\n{@link Ext.util.Grouper groupers} on the feature that it can then use to lookup\ninternal group information when grouping by different fields.\n\n    var feature = Ext.create('Ext.grid.feature.Grouping', {\n        startCollapsed: true,\n        groupers: [{\n            property: 'asset',\n            groupFn: function(val) {\n                return val.data.name;\n            }\n        }]\n    });\n\n## Example Usage\n\n    @example\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        fields: ['name', 'seniority', 'department'],\n        groupField: 'department',\n        data: [\n            { name: 'Michael Scott', seniority: 7, department: 'Management' },\n            { name: 'Dwight Schrute', seniority: 2, department: 'Sales' },\n            { name: 'Jim Halpert', seniority: 3, department: 'Sales' },\n            { name: 'Kevin Malone', seniority: 4, department: 'Accounting' },\n            { name: 'Angela Martin', seniority: 5, department: 'Accounting' }\n        ]\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {\n        title: 'Employees',\n        store: store,\n        columns: [\n            { text: 'Name', dataIndex: 'name', flex: 1 },\n            { text: 'Seniority', dataIndex: 'seniority', flex: 1 }\n        ],\n        features: [{ftype:'grouping'}],\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\n**Note:** To use grouping with a grid that has\n{@link Ext.grid.column.Column#locked locked columns}, you need to supply the grouping feature\nas a config object - so the grid can create two instances of the grouping feature.\n\n## Grouping Summary\n\nAn aggregate summary row may be added at the bottom of each group by setting\n{@link #cfg-showSummaryRow showSummaryRow} to `true`. There are two\naspects to the summary:\n\n## Calculation\n\nThe summary value needs to be calculated for each column in the grid. This is\ncontrolled by the {@link Ext.grid.column.Column#cfg-summaryType summaryType} option\nspecified on the column. There are several built in summary types which can be\nspecified as a string on the column configuration. These call underlying methods on\nthe store:\n\n - {@link Ext.data.Store#method-count count}\n - {@link Ext.data.Store#method-sum sum}\n - {@link Ext.data.Store#method-min min}\n - {@link Ext.data.Store#method-max max}\n - {@link Ext.data.Store#method-average average}\n\nAlternatively, the summaryType can be a function definition. If this is the case,\nthe function is called with two parameters:\n\n - records {Array} - an array of records\n - values {Array} - an array of field values to calculate the summary value\n\n## Rendering\n\nSimilar to a column, the summary also supports a\n{@link Ext.grid.column.Column.html#cfg-summaryRenderer summaryRenderer} function. This\nsummaryRenderer is called before displaying a value. The function is optional.  If\nnot specified, the default calculated value is shown. The summaryRenderer is called\nwith:\n\n - value {Object} - The calculated value.\n - summaryData {Object} - Contains all raw summary values for the row.\n - field {String} - The name of the field we are calculating\n - metaData {Object} - A collection of metadata about the current cell; can be used or\nmodified by the renderer.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n    @example\n    Ext.define('TestResult', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',\n        fields: ['student', 'subject', {\n            name: 'mark',\n            type: 'int'\n        }]\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {\n        width: 200,\n        height: 240,\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        features: [{\n            ftype: 'grouping',\n            groupHeaderTpl: 'Subject: {name}',\n            showSummaryRow: true\n        }],\n        store: {\n            model: 'TestResult',\n            groupField: 'subject',\n            data: [{\n                student: 'Student 1',\n                subject: 'Math',\n                mark: 84\n            },{\n                student: 'Student 1',\n                subject: 'Science',\n                mark: 72\n            },{\n                student: 'Student 2',\n                subject: 'Math',\n                mark: 96\n            },{\n                student: 'Student 2',\n                subject: 'Science',\n                mark: 68\n            }]\n        },\n        columns: [{\n            dataIndex: 'student',\n            text: 'Name',\n            summaryType: 'count',\n            summaryRenderer: function(value){\n                return Ext.String.format('{0} student{1}', value, value !== 1 ?

This style can be managed using that CSS class or by setting these Sass\nvariables in your theme or application:\n\n     $grid-filters-column-filtered-font-style: italic !default;\n\n     $grid-filters-column-filtered-font-weight: bold !default;\n\n## Stateful\n\nFilter information will be persisted across page loads by specifying a `{@link #cfg!stateId stateId}`\nin the Grid configuration. In actuality this state is saved by the `store`, but this\nplugin ensures that saved filters are properly identified and reclaimed on subsequent\nvisits to the page.\n\n## Grid Changes\n\n- A `filters` property is added to the Grid using this plugin.\n\n# Upgrading From Ext.ux.grid.FilterFeature\n\nThe biggest change for developers converting from the user extension is most likely the\nconversion to standard {@link Ext.data.AbstractStore#filters store filters}. In the\nprocess, the \"like\" and \"in\" operators are now supported by `{@link Ext.util.Filter}`.\nThese filters and all other filters added to the store will be sent in the standard\nway (using the \"filters\" parameter by default).\n\nSince this plugin now uses actual store filters, the `onBeforeLoad` listener and all\nhelper methods that were used to clean and build the params have been removed. The store\nwill send the filters managed by this plugin along in its normal request.\n",

We specified a Store which\nwill load JSON data inline.\nIn most apps we would be placing the grid inside another container and wouldn't need to\nuse the {@link #height}, {@link #width} and {@link #renderTo} configurations but they\nare included here to make it easy to get up and running.\n\nThe grid we created above will contain a header bar with a title ('Simpsons'), a row of\ncolumn headers directly underneath and finally the grid rows under the headers.\n\n**Height config with bufferedRenderer: true**\n\nThe {@link #height} config must be set when creating a grid using\n{@link #bufferedRenderer bufferedRenderer}: true _and_ the grid's height is not managed\nby an owning container layout.  In Ext JS 5.x bufferedRendering is true by default.\n\n## Configuring columns\n\nBy default, each column is sortable and will toggle between ASC and DESC sorting when\nyou click on its header. Each column header is also reorderable by default, and each\ngains a drop-down menu with options to hide and show columns.  It's easy to configure\neach column - here we use the same example as above and just modify the columns config:\n\n    columns: [\n        {\n            text: 'Name',\n            dataIndex: 'name',\n            sortable: false,\n            hideable: false,\n            flex: 1\n        },\n        {\n            text: 'Email',\n            dataIndex: 'email',\n            hidden: true\n        },\n        {\n            text: 'Phone',\n            dataIndex: 'phone',\n            width: 100\n        }\n    ]\n\nWe turned off sorting and hiding on the 'Name' column so clicking its header now has no\neffect. We also made the Email column hidden by default (it can be shown again by using\nthe menu on any other column). We also set the Phone column to a fixed with of 100px\nand flexed the Name column, which means it takes up all remaining width after the other\ncolumns have been accounted for. See the {@link Ext.grid.column.Column column docs} for\nmore details.\n\n## Renderers\n\nAs well as customizing columns, it's easy to alter the rendering of individual cells\nusing renderers. A renderer is tied to a particular column and is passed the value that\nwould be rendered into each cell in that column. For example, we could define a\nrenderer function for the email column to turn each email address into a mailto link:\n\n    columns: [\n        {\n            text: 'Email',\n            dataIndex: 'email',\n            renderer: function(value) {\n                return Ext.String.format('<a href=\"mailto:{0}\">{1}</a>', value, value);\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n\nSee the {@link Ext.grid.column.Column column docs} for more information on renderers.\n\n## Selection Models\n\nSometimes you simply want to render data for viewing, but usually it's\nnecessary to interact with or update that data. Grids use a concept called a Selection\nModel, which is simply a mechanism for selecting some part of the data in the grid. The\ntwo main types of Selection Model are RowSelectionModel, where entire rows are\nselected, and CellSelectionModel, where individual cells are selected.\n\nGrids use a Row Selection Model by default, but this is easy to customize like so:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {\n        selModel: 'cellmodel',\n        store: ...\n    });\n\n\nSpecifying the `cellmodel` changes a couple of things. Firstly, clicking on a cell now\nselects just that cell (using a {@link Ext.selection.RowModel rowmodel} will select the\nentire row), and secondly the keyboard navigation will walk from cell to cell instead\nof row to row. Cell-based selection models are usually used in conjunction with\nediting.\n\nYou may also utilize selModel as a config object for an instance of {@link Ext.selection.Model}.\n\nFor example:\n\n    selModel: {\n        selType: 'cellmodel',\n        mode   : 'MULTI'\n    }\n\nThis allows you to modify additional selection model configurations such as:\n\n+ {@link Ext.selection.Model#mode mode} - Specifies whether user may select multiple\nrows or single rows\n+ {@link Ext.selection.Model#allowDeselect allowDeselect} - Specifies whether user may\ndeselect records (when in SINGLE mode)\n+ {@link Ext.selection.Model#ignoreRightMouseSelection ignoreRightMouseSelection} - Specifies\nwhether user may ignore right clicks\nfor selection purposes\n\n## Sorting & Filtering\n\nEvery grid is attached to a {@link Ext.data.Store Store}, which provides multi-sort and\nfiltering capabilities. It's\neasy to set up a grid to be sorted from the start:\n\n    var myGrid = Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {\n        store: {\n            fields: ['name', 'email', 'phone'],\n            sorters: ['name', 'phone']\n        },\n        columns: [\n            { text: 'Name',  dataIndex: 'name' },\n            { text: 'Email', dataIndex: 'email' }\n        ]\n    });\n\nSorting at run time is easily accomplished by simply clicking each column header. If\nyou need to perform sorting on more than one field at run time it's easy to do so by\nadding new sorters to the store:\n\n    myGrid.store.sort([\n        { property: 'name',  direction: 'ASC' },\n        { property: 'email', direction: 'DESC' }\n    ]);\n\nSee {@link Ext.data.Store} for examples of filtering.\n\n## State saving\n\nWhen configured {@link #stateful}, grids save their column state (order and width)\nencapsulated within the default Panel state of changed width and height and\ncollapsed/expanded state.\n\nOn a `{@link #cfg!stateful stateful}` grid, not only should the Grid have a {@link #stateId}, each\n{@link #columns column} of the grid should also be configured with a\n{@link Ext.grid.column.Column#stateId stateId} which identifies that column locally\nwithin the grid.\n\nOmitting the `{@link #cfg!stateId stateId}` config from the columns results in columns with generated\ninternal ID's.  The generated ID's are subject to change on each page load\nmaking it impossible for the state manager to restore the previous state of the\ncolumns.\n\n## Plugins and Features\n\nGrid supports addition of extra functionality through features and plugins:\n\n- {@link Ext.grid.plugin.CellEditing CellEditing} - editing grid contents one cell at a time.\n\n- {@link Ext.grid.plugin.RowEditing RowEditing} - editing grid contents an entire row at a time.\n\n- {@link Ext.grid.plugin.DragDrop DragDrop} - drag-drop reordering of grid rows.\n\n- {@link Ext.toolbar.Paging Paging toolbar} - paging through large sets of data.\n\n- {@link Ext.grid.plugin.BufferedRenderer Infinite scrolling} - another way to handle\n  large sets of data.\n\n- {@link Ext.grid.RowNumberer RowNumberer} - automatically numbered rows.\n\n- {@link Ext.grid.feature.Grouping Grouping} - grouping together rows having the same value\n  in a particular field.\n\n- {@link Ext.grid.feature.Summary Summary} - a summary row at the bottom of a grid.\n\n- {@link Ext.grid.feature.GroupingSummary GroupingSummary} - a summary row at the bottom\n  of each group.\n",

The field that will be used for the editor is defined at the\n{@link Ext.grid.column.Column#editor editor}. The editor can be a field instance or a field\nconfiguration.\n\nIf an editor is not specified for a particular column then that cell will not be editable\nand it will be skipped when activated via the mouse or the keyboard.\n\nThe editor may be shared for each column in the grid, or a different one may be specified\nfor each column. An appropriate field type should be chosen to match the data structure\nthat it will be editing. For example, to edit a date, it would be useful to specify\n{@link Ext.form.field.Date} as the editor.\n\nIf the `editor` config on a column contains a `field` property, then the `editor` config\nis used to create the wrapping {@link Ext.grid.CellEditor CellEditor}, and the `field` property\nis used to create the editing  input field.\n\n## Example\n\nA grid with editor for the name and the email columns:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        storeId: 'simpsonsStore',\n        fields:[ 'name', 'email', 'phone'],\n        data: [\n            { name: 'Lisa', email: 'lisa@simpsons.com', phone: '555-111-1224' },\n            { name: 'Bart', email: 'bart@simpsons.com', phone: '555-222-1234' },\n            { name: 'Homer', email: 'homer@simpsons.com', phone: '555-222-1244' },\n            { name: 'Marge', email: 'marge@simpsons.com', phone: '555-222-1254' }\n        ]\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {\n        title: 'Simpsons',\n        store: Ext.data.StoreManager.lookup('simpsonsStore'),\n        columns: [\n            {header: 'Name', dataIndex: 'name', editor: 'textfield'},\n            {header: 'Email', dataIndex: 'email', flex:1,\n                editor: {\n                    completeOnEnter: false,\n\n                    // If the editor config contains a field property, then\n                    // the editor config is used to create the CellEditor\n                    // and the field property is used to create the editing input field.\n                    field: {\n                        xtype: 'textfield',\n                        allowBlank: false\n                    }\n                }\n            },\n            {header: 'Phone', dataIndex: 'phone'}\n        ],\n        selModel: 'cellmodel',\n        plugins: {\n            cellediting: {\n                clicksToEdit: 1\n            }\n        },\n        height: 200,\n        width: 400,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\nThis requires a little explanation. We're passing in `store` and `columns` as normal, but\nwe also specify a {@link Ext.grid.column.Column#field field} on two of our columns. For the\nName column we just want a default textfield to edit the value, so we specify 'textfield'.\nFor the Email column we customized the editor slightly by passing allowBlank: false, which\nwill provide inline validation.\n\nTo support cell editing, we also specified that the grid should use the 'cellmodel'\n{@link Ext.grid.Panel#selModel selModel}, and created an instance of the CellEditing plugin,\nwhich we configured to activate each editor after a single click.\n",

The DropZone will participate in drops\nfrom DragZones having the same {@link #ddGroup} including drops from within the same\ngrid.\n\nNote that where touch gestures are available, the `longpress` gesture will initiate\nthe drag in order that the `touchstart` may still be used to initiate a scroll.\n\nOn platforms which implement the [Pointer Events standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/)\n(IE), the `touchstart` event is usually claimed by the platform, however, this plugin\nuses the `longpress` event to trigger drags, so `touchstart` will not initiate a scroll.\nOn these platforms, a two finger drag gesture will scroll the content, or a single\nfinger drag on an empty area of the view will scroll the content.\n\nDuring the drop operation a data object is passed to a participating DropZone's drop\nhandlers.  The drag data object has the following properties:\n\n- **copy:** {@link Boolean} <br> The value of {@link #copy}.  Or `true` if\n{@link #allowCopy} is true **and** the control key was pressed as the drag operation\nbegan.\n\n- **view:** {@link Ext.grid.View GridView} <br> The source grid view from which the\ndrag originated\n\n- **ddel:** HTMLElement <br> The drag proxy element which moves with the cursor\n\n- **item:** HTMLElement <br> The grid view node upon which the mousedown event was\nregistered\n\n- **records:** {@link Array} <br> An Array of {@link Ext.data.Model Model}s\nrepresenting the selected data being dragged from the source grid view\n\nBy adding this plugin to a view, two new events will be fired from the client\ngrid view as well as its owning Grid: `{@link #beforedrop}` and `{@link #drop}`.\n\n    @example\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {\n        fields: ['name'],\n        data: [\n            [\"Lisa\"],\n            [\"Bart\"],\n            [\"Homer\"],\n            [\"Marge\"]\n        ],\n        proxy: {\n            type: 'memory',\n            reader: 'array'\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {\n        store: store,\n        enableLocking: true,\n        columns: [{\n            header: 'Name',\n            dataIndex: 'name',\n            flex: true\n        }],\n        viewConfig: {\n            plugins: {\n                gridviewdragdrop: {\n                    dragText: 'Drag and drop to reorganize'\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        height: 200,\n        width: 400,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n",

The following types of anchor values are supported:\n\n- **Percentage** : Any value between 1 and 100, expressed as a percentage.\n\n  The first anchor is the percentage width that the item should take up within the container,\n  and the second is the percentage height.  For example:\n\n      // two values specified\n      anchor: '100% 50%' // render item complete width of the container and\n                         // 1/2 height of the container\n      // one value specified\n      anchor: '100%'     // the width value; the height will default to auto\n\n- **Offsets** : Any positive or negative integer value.\n\n  This is a raw adjustment where the first anchor is the offset from the right edge\n  of the container, and the second is the offset from the bottom edge. For example:\n\n      // two values specified\n      anchor: '-50 -100' // render item the complete width of the container\n                         // minus 50 pixels and\n                         // the complete height minus 100 pixels.\n      // one value specified\n      anchor: '-50'      // anchor value is assumed to be the right offset value\n                         // bottom offset will default to 0\n\n- **Sides** : Valid values are `right` (or `r`) and `bottom` (or `b`).\n\n  Either the container must have a fixed size or an anchorSize config value defined\n  at render time in order for these to have any effect.\n\n- **Mixed** :\n\n  Anchor values can also be mixed as needed.  For example, to render the width offset\n  from the container right edge by 50 pixels and 75% of the container's height use:\n\n      anchor:   '-50 75%'\n"

        "doc": "This layout manages multiple child Components, each fitted to the Container, where only\na single child Component can be visible at any given time.  This layout style is most commonly\nused for wizards, tab implementations, etc. This class is intended to be extended or created\nvia the `layout: 'card'` {@link Ext.container.Container#layout} config, and should generally\nnot need to be created directly via the new keyword.\n\nThe CardLayout's focal method is {@link #setActiveItem}.  Since only one panel is displayed\nat a time, the only way to move from one Component to the next is by calling setActiveItem,\npassing the next panel to display (or its id or index).  The layout itself does not provide\na user interface for handling this navigation, so that functionality must be provided\nby the developer.\n\nTo change the active card of a container, call the setActiveItem method of its layout:\n\n    @example\n    var p = Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', {\n        layout: 'card',\n        items: [\n            { html: 'Card 1' },\n            { html: 'Card 2' }\n        ],\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\n    p.getLayout().setActiveItem(1);\n\nThe {@link Ext.Component#beforedeactivate beforedeactivate} and\n{@link Ext.Component#beforeactivate beforeactivate} events can be used to prevent a card\nfrom activating or deactivating by returning `false`.\n\n    @example\n    var active = 0;\n    var main = Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', {\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        width: 200,\n        height: 200,\n        layout: 'card',\n        tbar: [{\n            text: 'Next',\n            handler: function(){\n                var layout = main.getLayout();\n                ++active;\n                layout.setActiveItem(active);\n                active = main.items.indexOf(layout.getActiveItem());\n            }\n        }],\n        items: [{\n            title: 'P1'\n        }, {\n            title: 'P2'\n        }, {\n            title: 'P3',\n            listeners: {\n                beforeactivate: function(){\n                    return false;\n                }\n            }\n        }]\n    });\n\nIn the following example, a simplistic wizard setup is demonstrated.  A button bar is added\nto the footer of the containing panel to provide navigation buttons.  The buttons will be handled\nby a common navigation routine.  Note that other uses of a CardLayout (like a tab control)\nwould require a completely different implementation.  For serious implementations,\na better approach would be to extend CardLayout to provide the custom functionality needed.\n\n    @example\n    var navigate = function(panel, direction){\n        // This routine could contain business logic required to manage the navigation steps.\n        // It would call setActiveItem as needed, manage navigation button state, handle any\n        // branching logic that might be required, handle alternate actions like cancellation\n        // or finalization, etc.  A complete wizard implementation could get pretty\n        // sophisticated depending on the complexity required, and should probably be\n        // done as a subclass of CardLayout in a real-world implementation.\n        var layout = panel.getLayout();\n        layout[direction]();\n        Ext.getCmp('move-prev').setDisabled(!layout.getPrev());\n        Ext.getCmp('move-next').setDisabled(!layout.getNext());\n    };\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', {\n        title: 'Example Wizard',\n        width: 300,\n        height: 200,\n        layout: 'card',\n        bodyStyle: 'padding:15px',\n        defaults: {\n            // applied to each contained panel\n            border: false\n        },\n        // just an example of one possible navigation scheme, using buttons\n        bbar: [\n            {\n                id: 'move-prev',\n                text: 'Back',\n                handler: function(btn) {\n                    navigate(btn.up(\"panel\"), \"prev\");\n                },\n                disabled: true\n            },\n            '->', // greedy spacer so that the buttons are aligned to each side\n            {\n                id: 'move-next',\n                text: 'Next',\n                handler: function(btn) {\n                    navigate(btn.up(\"panel\"), \"next\");\n                }\n            }\n        ],\n        // the panels (or \"cards\") within the layout\n        items: [{\n            id: 'card-0',\n            html: '<h1>Welcome to the Wizard!</h1><p>Step 1 of 3</p>'\n        },{\n            id: 'card-1',\n            html: '<p>Step 2 of 3</p>'\n        },{\n            id: 'card-2',\n            html: '<h1>Congratulations!</h1><p>Step 3 of 3 - Complete</p>'\n        }],\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n",

This class is intended to be extended or created\nvia the `layout: 'column'` {@link Ext.container.Container#layout} config, and should generally\nnot need to be created directly via the new keyword.\n\nColumnLayout does not have any direct config options (other than inherited ones), but it does\nsupport a specific config property of `columnWidth` that can be included in the config\nof any panel added to it. The layout will use the columnWidth (if present) or width of each panel\nduring layout to determine how to size each panel. If width or columnWidth is not specified\nfor a given panel, its width will default to the panel's width (or auto).\n\nThe width property is always evaluated as pixels, and must be a number greater than or equal\nto 1. The columnWidth property is always evaluated as a percentage, and must be a decimal value\ngreater than 0 and less than 1 (e.g., .25).\n\nThe basic rules for specifying column widths are pretty simple. The logic makes two passes\nthrough the set of contained panels. During the first layout pass, all panels that either\nhave a fixed width or none specified (auto) are skipped, but their widths are subtracted\nfrom the overall container width.\n\nDuring the second pass, all panels with columnWidths are assigned pixel widths in proportion\nto their percentages based on the total **remaining** container width. In other words,\npercentage width panels are designed to fill the space left over by all the fixed-width\nand/or auto-width panels. Because of this, while you can specify any number of columns\nwith different percentages, the columnWidths must always add up to 1 (or 100%) when added\ntogether, otherwise your layout may not render as expected.\n\n    @example\n    // All columns are percentages -- they must add up to 1\n    Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', {\n        title: 'Column Layout - Percentage Only',\n        width: 350,\n        height: 250,\n        layout:'column',\n        items: [{\n            title: 'Column 1',\n            columnWidth: 0.25\n        }, {\n            title: 'Column 2',\n            columnWidth: 0.55\n        }, {\n            title: 'Column 3',\n            columnWidth: 0.20\n        }],\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\n    // Mix of width and columnWidth -- all columnWidth values must add up\n    // to 1. The first column will take up exactly 120px, and the last two\n    // columns will fill the remaining container width.\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.Panel', {\n        title: 'Column Layout - Mixed',\n        width: 350,\n        height: 250,\n        layout:'column',\n        items: [{\n            title: 'Column 1',\n            width: 120\n        }, {\n            title: 'Column 2',\n            columnWidth: 0.7\n        }, {\n            title: 'Column 3',\n            columnWidth: 0.3\n        }],\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n",

The total number of columns\ncan be specified, and rowspan and colspan can be used to create complex layouts within the table.\nThis class is intended to be extended or created via the `layout: {type: 'table'}`\n{@link Ext.container.Container#layout} config, and should generally not need to be created\ndirectly via the new keyword.\n\nNote that when creating a layout via config, the layout-specific config properties must be passed\nin via the {@link Ext.container.Container#layout} object which will then be applied internally\nto the layout. In the case of TableLayout, the only valid layout config properties are\n{@link #columns} and {@link #tableAttrs}. However, the items added to a TableLayout can supply\nthe following table-specific config properties:\n\n  - **rowspan** Applied to the table cell containing the item.\n  - **colspan** Applied to the table cell containing the item.\n  - **cellCls** A CSS class name added to the table cell containing the item.\n\nThe basic concept of building up a TableLayout is conceptually very similar to building up\na standard HTML table. You simply add each panel (or \"cell\") that you want to include along\nwith any span attributes specified as the special config properties of rowspan and colspan\nwhich work exactly like their HTML counterparts. Rather than explicitly creating and nesting rows\nand columns as you would in HTML, you simply specify the total column count in the layout config\nand start adding panels in their natural order from left to right, top to bottom. The layout will\nautomatically figure out, based on the column count, rowspans and colspans, how to position each\npanel within the table.

        "type": "Ext.layout.Context",
        "doc": "Manages context information during a layout.\n\n# Algorithm\n\nThis class performs the following jobs:\n\n - Cache DOM reads to avoid reading the same values repeatedly.\n - Buffer DOM writes and flush them as a block to avoid read/write interleaving.\n - Track layout dependencies so each layout does not have to figure out the source of\n   its dependent values.\n - Intelligently run layouts when the values on which they depend change (a trigger).\n - Allow layouts to avoid processing when required values are unavailable (a block).\n\nWork done during layout falls into either a \"read phase\" or a \"write phase\" and it is\nessential to always be aware of the current phase. Most methods in\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout Layout} are called during a read phase:\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#calculate calculate},\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#completeLayout completeLayout} and\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#finalizeLayout finalizeLayout}. The exceptions to this are\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#beginLayout beginLayout},\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#beginLayoutCycle beginLayoutCycle} and\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#finishedLayout finishedLayout} which are called during\na write phase. While {@link Ext.layout.Layout#finishedLayout finishedLayout} is called\na write phase, it is really intended to be a catch-all for post-processing after a\nlayout run.\n\nIn a read phase, it is OK to read the DOM but this should be done using the appropriate\n{@link Ext.layout.ContextItem ContextItem} where possible since that provides a cache\nto avoid redundant reads. No writes should be made to the DOM in a read phase! Instead,\nthe values should be written to the proper ContextItem for later write-back.\n\nThe rules flip-flop in a write phase. The only difference is that ContextItem methods\nlike {@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#getStyle getStyle} will still read the DOM unless the\nvalue was previously read. This detail is unknowable from the outside of ContextItem, so\nread calls to ContextItem should also be avoided in a write phase.\n\nCalculating interdependent layouts requires a certain amount of iteration. In a given\ncycle, some layouts will contribute results that allow other layouts to proceed. The\ngeneral flow then is to gather all of the layouts (both component and container) in a\ncomponent tree and queue them all for processing. The initial queue order is bottom-up\nand component layout first, then container layout (if applicable) for each component.\n\nThis initial step also calls the beginLayout method on all layouts to clear any values\nfrom the DOM that might interfere with calculations and measurements. In other words,\nthis is a \"write phase\" and reads from the DOM should be strictly avoided.\n\nNext the layout enters into its iterations or \"cycles\". Each cycle consists of calling\nthe {@link Ext.layout.Layout#calculate calculate} method on all layouts in the\n{@link #layoutQueue}. These calls are part of a \"read phase\" and writes to the DOM should\nbe strictly avoided.\n\n# Considerations\n\n**RULE 1**: Respect the read/write cycles. Always use the\n{@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#getProp getProp}\nor {@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#getDomProp getDomProp} methods to get calculated values;\nonly use the {@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#getStyle getStyle} method to read styles; use\n{@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#setProp setProp} to set DOM values. Some reads will, of\ncourse, still go directly to the DOM, but if there is a method in\n{@link Ext.layout.ContextItem ContextItem} to do a certain job, it should be used instead\nof a lower-level equivalent.\n\nThe basic logic flow in {@link Ext.layout.Layout#calculate calculate} consists of gathering\nvalues by calling {@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#getProp getProp} or\n{@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#getDomProp getDomProp}, calculating results and publishing\nthem by calling {@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#setProp setProp}. It is important to realize\nthat {@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#getProp getProp} will return `undefined` if the value\nis not yet known. But the act of calling the method is enough to track the fact that the\ncalling layout depends (in some way) on this value. In other words, the calling layout is\n\"triggered\" by the properties it requests.\n\n**RULE 2**: Avoid calling {@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#getProp getProp} unless the value\nis needed. Gratuitous calls cause inefficiency because the layout will appear to depend on\nvalues that it never actually uses. This applies equally to\n{@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#getDomProp getDomProp} and the test-only methods\n{@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#hasProp hasProp} and\n{@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#hasDomProp hasDomProp}.\n\nBecause {@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#getProp getProp} can return `undefined`, it is often\nthe case that subsequent math will produce NaN's. This is usually not a problem as the\nNaN's simply propagate along and result in final results that are NaN. Both `undefined`\nand NaN are ignored by {@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#setProp}, so it is often not necessary\nto even know that this is happening. It does become important for determining if a layout\nis not done or if it might lead to publishing an incorrect (but not NaN or `undefined`)\nvalue.\n\n**RULE 3**: If a layout has not calculated all the values it is required to calculate, it\nmust set {@link Ext.layout.Layout#done done} to `false` before returning from\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#calculate calculate}. This value is always `true` on entry because\nit is simpler to detect the incomplete state rather than the complete state (especially up\nand down a class hierarchy).\n\n**RULE 4**: A layout must never publish an incomplete (wrong) result. Doing so would cause\ndependent layouts to run their calculations on those wrong values, producing more wrong\nvalues and some layouts may even incorrectly flag themselves as\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#done done} before the correct values are determined and republished.\nDoing this will poison the calculations.\n\n**RULE 5**: Each value should only be published by one layout. If multiple layouts attempt\nto publish the same values, it would be nearly impossible to avoid breaking **RULE 4**. To\nhelp detect this problem, the layout diagnostics will trap on an attempt to set a value\nfrom different layouts.\n\nComplex layouts can produce many results as part of their calculations. These values are\nimportant for other layouts to proceed and need to be published by the earliest possible\ncall to {@link Ext.layout.Layout#calculate} to avoid unnecessary cycles and poor performance.\nIt is also possible, however, for some results to be related in a way such that publishing them\nmay be an all-or-none proposition (typically to avoid breaking *RULE 4*).\n\n**RULE 6**: Publish results as soon as they are known to be correct rather than wait for\nall values to be calculated. Waiting for everything to be complete can lead to deadlock.\nThe key here is not to forget **RULE 4** in the process.\n\nSome layouts depend on certain critical values as part of their calculations. For example,\nHBox depends on width and cannot do anything until the width is known. In these cases, it\nis best to use {@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#block block} or\n{@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#domBlock domBlock} and thereby avoid processing the layout\nuntil the needed value is available.\n\n**RULE 7**: Use {@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#block block} or\n{@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#domBlock domBlock} when values are required to make progress.\nThis will mimize wasted recalculations.\n\n**RULE 8**: Blocks should only be used when no forward progress can be made. If even one\nvalue could still be calculated, a block could result in a deadlock.\n\nHistorically, layouts have been invoked directly by component code, sometimes in places\nlike an `afterLayout` method for a child component. With the flexibility now available\nto solve complex, iterative issues, such things should be done in a responsible layout\n(be it component or container).\n\n**RULE 9**: Use layouts to solve layout issues and don't wait for the layout to finish to\nperform further layouts. This is especially important now that layouts process entire\ncomponent trees and not each layout in isolation.\n\n# Sequence Diagram\n\nThe simplest sequence diagram for a layout run looks roughly like this:\n\n      Context         Layout 1     Item 1     Layout 2     Item 2\n         |               |           |           |           |\n    ---->X-------------->X           |           |           |\n    run  X---------------|-----------|---------->X           |\n         X beginLayout   |           |           |           |\n         X               |           |           |           |\n       A X-------------->X           |           |           |\n         X  calculate    X---------->X           |           |\n         X             C X  getProp  |           |           |\n       B X               X---------->X           |           |\n         X               |  setProp  |           |           |\n         X               |           |           |           |\n       D X---------------|-----------|---------->X           |\n         X  calculate    |           |           X---------->X\n         X               |           |           |  setProp  |\n       E X               |           |           |           |\n         X---------------|-----------|---------->X           |\n         X completeLayout|           |         F |           |\n         X               |           |           |           |\n       G X               |           |           |           |\n       H X-------------->X           |           |           |\n         X  calculate    X---------->X           |           |\n         X             I X  getProp  |           |           |\n         X               X---------->X           |           |\n         X               |  setProp  |           |           |\n       J X-------------->X           |           |           |\n         X completeLayout|           |           |           |\n         X               |           |           |           |\n       K X-------------->X           |           |           |\n         X---------------|-----------|---------->X           |\n         X finalizeLayout|           |           |           |\n         X               |           |           |           |\n       L X-------------->X           |           |           |\n         X---------------|-----------|---------->X           |\n         X finishedLayout|           |           |           |\n         X               |           |           |           |\n       M X-------------->X           |           |           |\n         X---------------|-----------|---------->X           |\n         X notifyOwner   |           |           |           |\n       N |               |           |           |           |\n         -               -           -           -           -\n\n\nNotes:\n\n**A.** This is a call from the {@link #run} method to the {@link #run} method.\nEach layout in the queue will have its {@link Ext.layout.Layout#calculate calculate}\nmethod called.\n\n**B.** After each {@link Ext.layout.Layout#calculate calculate} method is called the\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#done done} flag is checked to see if the Layout has completed.\nIf it has completed and that layout object implements a\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#completeLayout completeLayout} method, this layout is queued to\nreceive its call. Otherwise, the layout will be queued again unless there are blocks or\ntriggers that govern its requeueing.\n\n**C.** The call to {@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#getProp getProp} is made to the Item\nand that will be tracked as a trigger (keyed by the name of the property being requested).\nChanges to this property will cause this layout to be requeued. The call to\n{@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#setProp setProp} will place a value in the item and not\ndirectly into the DOM.\n\n**D.** Call the other layouts now in the first cycle (repeat **B** and **C** for each\nlayout).\n\n**E.** After completing a cycle, if progress was made (new properties were written to\nthe context) and if the {@link #layoutQueue} is not empty, the next cycle is run. If no\nprogress was made or no layouts are ready to run, all buffered values are written to\nthe DOM (a flush).\n\n**F.** After flushing, any layouts that were marked as {@link Ext.layout.Layout#done done}\nthat also have a {@link Ext.layout.Layout#completeLayout completeLayout} method are called.\nThis can cause them to become no longer done (see {@link #invalidate}). As with\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#calculate calculate}, this is considered a \"read phase\" and\ndirect DOM writes should be avoided.\n\n**G.** Flushing and calling any pending {@link Ext.layout.Layout#completeLayout completeLayout}\nmethods will likely trigger layouts that called\n{@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#getDomProp getDomProp} and unblock layouts that have called\n{@link Ext.layout.ContextItem#domBlock domBlock}. These variants are used when a layout\nneeds the value to be correct in the DOM and not simply known. If this does not cause\nat least one layout to enter the queue, we have a layout FAILURE. Otherwise, we continue\nwith the next cycle.\n\n**H.** Call {@link Ext.layout.Layout#calculate calculate} on any layouts in the queue\nat the start of this cycle. Just a repeat of **B** through **G**.\n\n**I.** Once the layout has calculated all that it is resposible for, it can leave itself\nin the {@link Ext.layout.Layout#done done} state. This is the value on entry to\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#calculate calculate} and must be cleared in that call if the\nlayout has more work to do.\n\n**J.** Now that all layouts are done, flush any DOM values and\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#completeLayout completeLayout} calls. This can again cause\nlayouts to become not done, and so we will be back on another cycle if that happens.\n\n**K.** After all layouts are done, call the\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#finalizeLayout finalizeLayout} method on any layouts that have one.\nAs with {@link Ext.layout.Layout#completeLayout completeLayout}, this can cause layouts\nto become no longer done. This is less desirable than using\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#completeLayout completeLayout} because it will cause all\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#finalizeLayout finalizeLayout} methods to be called again\nwhen we think things are all wrapped up.\n\n**L.** After finishing the last iteration, layouts that have a\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#finishedLayout finishedLayout} method will be called. This\ncall will only happen once per run and cannot cause layouts to be run further.\n\n**M.** After calling finahedLayout, layouts that have a\n{@link Ext.layout.Layout#notifyOwner notifyOwner} method will be called. This\ncall will only happen once per run and cannot cause layouts to be run further.\n\n**N.** One last flush to make sure everything has been written to the DOM.\n\n# Inter-Layout Collaboration\n\nMany layout problems require collaboration between multiple layouts. In some cases, this\nis as simple as a component's container layout providing results used by its component\nlayout or vise-versa. A slightly more distant collaboration occurs in a box layout when\nstretchmax is used: the child item's component layout provides results that are consumed\nby the ownerCt's box layout to determine the size of the children.\n\nThe various forms of interdependence between a container and its children are described by\neach components' {@link Ext.Component#getSizeModel size model}.\n\nTo facilitate this collaboration, the following pairs of properties are published to the\ncomponent's {@link Ext.layout.ContextItem ContextItem}:\n\n - width/height: These hold the final size of the component. The layout indicated by the\n   {@link Ext.Component#getSizeModel size model} is responsible for setting these.\n - contentWidth/contentHeight: These hold size information published by the container\n   layout or from DOM measurement. These describe the content only. These values are\n   used by the component layout to determine the outer width/height when that component\n   is {@link Ext.Component#shrinkWrap shrink-wrapped}. They are also used to\n   determine overflow. All container layouts must publish these values for dimensions\n   that are shrink-wrapped. If a component has raw content (not container items), the\n   componentLayout must publish these values instead.\n",

Generally speaking, only properties defined in a class config\nblock (including ancestor config blocks and mixins) are eligible for publishing\nto the viewModel.

If `{@link #cfg!reference reference}` is not set then this config\nis ignored.\n\nBy using this config and `{@link #cfg-reference}` you can bind configs between\ncomponents. For example:\n\n     ...\n         items: [{\n             xtype: 'textfield',\n             reference: 'somefield',  // component's name in the ViewModel\n             publishes: 'value' // value is not published by default\n         },{\n             ...\n         },{\n             xtype: 'displayfield',\n             bind: 'You have entered \"{somefield.value}\"'\n         }]\n     ...\n\nClasses must provide this config as an Object:\n\n     Ext.define('App.foo.Bar', {\n         publishes: {\n             foo: true,\n             bar: true\n         }\n     });\n\nThis is required for the config system to properly merge values from derived\nclasses.\n\nFor instances this value can be specified as a value as show above or an array\nor object as follows:\n\n     {\n         xtype: 'textfield',\n         reference: 'somefield',\n         publishes: [\n             'value',\n             'rawValue',\n             'dirty'\n         ]\n     }\n\n     // This achieves the same result as the above array form.\n     {\n         xtype: 'textfield',\n         reference: 'somefield',\n         publishes: {\n             value: true,\n             rawValue: true,\n             dirty: true\n         }\n     }\n\nIn some cases, users may want to publish a property to the viewModel that is not found\nin a class  config block. In these situations, you may utilize {@link #publishState}\nif the property has a  setter method. Let's use\n{@link Ext.form.Labelable#setFieldLabel setFieldLabel} as an example:\n\n      setFieldLabel: function(fieldLabel) {\n          this.callParent(arguments);\n          this.publishState('fieldLabel', fieldLabel);\n      }\n\nWith the above chunk of code, fieldLabel may now be published to the viewModel.\n",

        "doc": "This class provides dynamic loading support for JavaScript classes. Application code\ndoes not typically need to call `{@link Ext.Loader}` except perhaps to configure path mappings\nwhen not using [Sencha Cmd](http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/).\n\n     Ext.Loader.setPath('MyApp', 'app');\n\nWhen using Sencha Cmd, this is handled by the \"bootstrap\" provided by the application\nbuild script and such configuration is not necessary.\n\n# Typical Usage\n\nThe `{@link Ext.Loader}` is most often used behind the scenes to satisfy class references in\nclass declarations. Like so:\n\n     Ext.define('MyApp.view.Main', {\n         extend: 'Ext.panel.Panel',\n\n         mixins: [\n             'MyApp.util.Mixin'\n         ],\n\n         requires: [\n             'Ext.grid.Panel'\n         ],\n\n         uses: [\n             'MyApp.util.Stuff'\n         ]\n     });\n\nIn all of these cases, `{@link Ext.Loader}` is used internally to resolve these class names\nand ensure that the necessary class files are loaded.\n\nDuring development, these files are loaded individually for optimal debugging. For a\nproduction use, [Sencha Cmd](http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/) will replace\nall of these strings with the actual resolved class references because it ensures that\nthe classes are all contained in the build in the correct order. In development, these\nfiles will not be loaded until the `MyApp.view.Main` class indicates they are needed\nas shown above.\n\n# Loading Classes\n\nYou can also use `{@link Ext.Loader}` directly to load classes or files. The simplest form of\nuse is `{@link Ext#require}`.\n\nFor example:\n\n     Ext.require('MyApp.view.Main', function () {\n         // On callback, the MyApp.view.Main class is now loaded\n\n         var view = new MyApp.view.Main();\n     });\n\nYou can alternatively require classes by alias or wildcard.\n\n    Ext.require('widget.window');\n\n    Ext.require(['widget.window', 'layout.border', 'Ext.data.Connection']);\n\n    Ext.require(['widget.*', 'layout.*', 'Ext.data.*']);\n\nThe callback function is optional.\n\n**Note** Using `Ext.require` at global scope will cause `{@link Ext#onReady}` and\n`{@link Ext.app.Application#launch}` methods to be deferred until the required classes\nare loaded. It is these cases where the callback function is most often unnecessary.\n\n## Using Excludes\n\nAlternatively, you can exclude what you don't need:\n\n    // Include everything except Ext.tree.*\n    Ext.exclude('Ext.tree.*').require('*');\n\n    // Include all widgets except widget.checkbox* (this will exclude\n    // widget.checkbox, widget.checkboxfield, widget.checkboxgroup, etc.)\n    Ext.exclude('widget.checkbox*').require('widget.*');\n\n# Dynamic Instantiation\n\nAnother feature enabled by `{@link Ext.Loader}` is instantiation using class names or aliases.\n\nFor example:\n\n     var win = Ext.create({\n         xtype: 'window',\n\n         // or\n         // xclass: 'Ext.window.Window'\n\n         title: 'Hello'\n     });\n\nThis form of creation can be useful if the type to create (`window` in the above) is\nnot known statically. Internally, `{@link Ext#method!create}` may need to *synchronously*\nload the desired class and its requirements. Doing this will generate a warning in\nthe console:\n\n     [Ext.Loader] Synchronously loading 'Ext.window.Window'...\n\nIf you see these in your debug console, you should add the indicated class(es) to the\nappropriate `requires` array (as above) or make an `{@link Ext#require}` call.\n\n\n**Note** Using `{@link Ext#method!create}` has some performance overhead and is best reserved\nfor cases where the target class is not known until run-time.\n",

Generally speaking, only properties defined in a class config\nblock (including ancestor config blocks and mixins) are eligible for publishing\nto the viewModel.

If `{@link #cfg!reference reference}` is not set then this config\nis ignored.\n\nBy using this config and `{@link #cfg-reference}` you can bind configs between\ncomponents. For example:\n\n     ...\n         items: [{\n             xtype: 'textfield',\n             reference: 'somefield',  // component's name in the ViewModel\n             publishes: 'value' // value is not published by default\n         },{\n             ...\n         },{\n             xtype: 'displayfield',\n             bind: 'You have entered \"{somefield.value}\"'\n         }]\n     ...\n\nClasses must provide this config as an Object:\n\n     Ext.define('App.foo.Bar', {\n         publishes: {\n             foo: true,\n             bar: true\n         }\n     });\n\nThis is required for the config system to properly merge values from derived\nclasses.\n\nFor instances this value can be specified as a value as show above or an array\nor object as follows:\n\n     {\n         xtype: 'textfield',\n         reference: 'somefield',\n         publishes: [\n             'value',\n             'rawValue',\n             'dirty'\n         ]\n     }\n\n     // This achieves the same result as the above array form.\n     {\n         xtype: 'textfield',\n         reference: 'somefield',\n         publishes: {\n             value: true,\n             rawValue: true,\n             dirty: true\n         }\n     }\n\nIn some cases, users may want to publish a property to the viewModel that is not found\nin a class  config block. In these situations, you may utilize {@link #publishState}\nif the property has a  setter method. Let's use\n{@link Ext.form.Labelable#setFieldLabel setFieldLabel} as an example:\n\n      setFieldLabel: function(fieldLabel) {\n          this.callParent(arguments);\n          this.publishState('fieldLabel', fieldLabel);\n      }\n\nWith the above chunk of code, fieldLabel may now be published to the viewModel.\n",

Do you want to save changes?',\n        buttons: Ext.Msg.YESNOCANCEL,\n        icon: Ext.Msg.QUESTION,\n        fn: function(btn) {\n            if (btn === 'yes') {\n                console.log('Yes pressed');\n            } else if (btn === 'no') {\n                console.log('No pressed');\n            } else {\n                console.log('Cancel pressed');\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nShowing Ext.Msg while it's already shown will cause the visible instance to be\noverwritten with the newly passed config.  While this may be the desired outcome, you\ncan also create a new MessageBox that can exist alongside the Ext.Msg\nsingleton instance.\n\n    @example\n    var myMsg = Ext.create('Ext.window.MessageBox', {\n        // set closeAction to 'destroy' if this instance is not\n        // intended to be reused by the application\n        closeAction: 'destroy'\n    }).show({\n        title: 'Custom MessageBox Instance',\n        message: 'I can exist along with Ext.Msg'\n    });\n\n    Ext.Msg.alert('Overlapping', 'Ext.Msg instance');\n\n## Static Values\n\nThe following values can be utilized by Ext.window.MessageBox and Ext.Msg:\n\n    OK    : {text: 'OK',     itemId: 'ok'}\n    YES   : {text: 'Yes',    itemId: 'yes'}\n    NO    : {text: 'No',     itemId: 'no'}\n    CANCEL: {text: 'Cancel', itemId: 'cancel'}\n\n    INFO    : Ext.baseCSSPrefix + 'msgbox-info'\n    WARNING : Ext.baseCSSPrefix + 'msgbox-warning'\n    QUESTION: Ext.baseCSSPrefix + 'msgbox-question'\n    ERROR   : Ext.baseCSSPrefix + 'msgbox-error'\n\n    OKCANCEL: [\n        {text: 'Cancel', itemId: 'cancel'},\n        {text: 'OK',     itemId: 'ok'}\n    ]\n\n    YESNOCANCEL: [\n        {text: 'Cancel', itemId: 'cancel'},\n        {text: 'No',     itemId: 'no'},\n        {text: 'Yes',    itemId: 'yes'}\n    ]\n\n    YESNO: [\n        {text: 'No',  itemId: 'no'},\n        {text: 'Yes', itemId: 'yes'}\n    ]\n",

    "Ext.Mixin": {
        "type": "Ext.Mixin",
        "doc": "This class is a base class for mixins. These are classes that extend this class and are\ndesigned to be used as a `{@link #static-method!mixin mixin}` by user code.\n\nIt provides mixins with the ability to \"hook\" class methods of the classes in to which\nthey are mixed. For example, consider the `{@link #method!destroy destroy}` method pattern. If a mixin class\nhad cleanup requirements, it would need to be called as part of `{@link #method!destroy destroy}`.\n\nStarting with a basic class we might have:\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Base', {\n         destroy: function() {\n             console.log('B');\n             // cleanup\n         }\n     });\n\nA derived class would look like this:\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Derived', {\n         extend: 'Foo.bar.Base',\n\n         destroy: function() {\n             console.log('D');\n             // more cleanup\n\n             this.callParent(); // let Foo.bar.Base cleanup as well\n         }\n     });\n\nTo see how using this class help, start with a \"normal\" mixin class that also needs to\ncleanup its resources. These mixins must be called explicitly by the classes that use\nthem. For example:\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Util', {\n         destroy: function() {\n             console.log('U');\n         }\n     });\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Derived', {\n         extend: 'Foo.bar.Base',\n\n         mixins: {\n             util: 'Foo.bar.Util'\n         },\n\n         destroy: function() {\n             console.log('D');\n             // more cleanup\n\n             this.mixins.util.destroy.call(this);\n\n             this.callParent(); // let Foo.bar.Base cleanup as well\n         }\n     });\n\n     var obj = new Foo.bar.Derived();\n\n     obj.destroy();\n     // logs D then U then B\n\nThis class is designed to solve the above in simpler and more reliable way.\n\n## mixinConfig\n\nUsing `mixinConfig` the mixin class can provide \"before\" or \"after\" hooks that do not\ninvolve the derived class implementation. This also means the derived class cannot\nadjust parameters to the hook methods.\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Util', {\n         extend: 'Ext.Mixin',\n\n         mixinConfig: {\n             after: {\n                 destroy: 'destroyUtil'\n             }\n         },\n\n         destroyUtil: function() {\n             console.log('U');\n         }\n     });\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Class', {\n         mixins: {\n             util: 'Foo.bar.Util'\n         },\n\n         destroy: function() {\n             console.log('D');\n         }\n     });\n\n     var obj = new Foo.bar.Derived();\n\n     obj.destroy();\n     // logs D then U\n\n If the destruction should occur in the other order, you can use `before`:\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Util', {\n         extend: 'Ext.Mixin',\n\n         mixinConfig: {\n             before: {\n                 destroy: 'destroyUtil'\n             }\n         },\n\n         destroyUtil: function() {\n             console.log('U');\n         }\n     });\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Class', {\n         mixins: {\n             util: 'Foo.bar.Util'\n         },\n\n         destroy: function() {\n             console.log('D');\n         }\n     });\n\n     var obj = new Foo.bar.Derived();\n\n     obj.destroy();\n     // logs U then D\n\n### Configs\n\nNormally when a mixin defines `config` properties and the class into which the mixin is\ninitially mixed needs to specify values for those configs, the class processor does not\nyet recognize these config and instead retains the properties on te target class\nprototype.\n\nChanging the above behavior would potentially break application code, so this class\nprovides a way to remedy this:\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Util', {\n         extend: 'Ext.Mixin',\n\n         mixinConfig: {\n             configs: true\n         },\n\n         config: {\n             foo: null\n         }\n     });\n\nNow the direct user class can correctly specify `foo` config properties:\n\n     Ext.define('Some.other.Class', {\n         mixins: [\n             'Foo.bar.Util'\n         ],\n\n         foo: 'bar'  // recognized as the foo config form Foo.bar.Util\n     });\n\n### Chaining\n\nOne way for a mixin to provide methods that act more like normal inherited methods is\nto use an `on` declaration. These methods will be injected into the `callParent` chain\nbetween the derived and superclass. For example:\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Util', {\n         extend: 'Ext.Mixin',\n\n         mixinConfig: {\n             on: {\n                 destroy: function() {\n                     console.log('M');\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n     });\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Base', {\n         destroy: function() {\n             console.log('B');\n         }\n     });\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Derived', {\n         extend: 'Foo.bar.Base',\n\n         mixins: {\n             util: 'Foo.bar.Util'\n         },\n\n         destroy: function() {\n             this.callParent();\n             console.log('D');\n         }\n     });\n\n     var obj = new Foo.bar.Derived();\n\n     obj.destroy();\n     // logs M then B then D\n\nAs with `before` and `after`, the value of `on` can be a method name.\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Util', {\n         extend: 'Ext.Mixin',\n\n         mixinConfig: {\n             on: {\n                 destroy: 'onDestroy'\n             }\n         }\n\n         onDestroy: function() {\n             console.log('M');\n         }\n     });\n\nBecause this technique leverages `callParent`, the derived class controls the time and\nparameters for the call to all of its bases (be they `{@link #static-method!extend extend}` or `{@link #static-method!mixin mixin}` flavor).\n\n### Derivations\n\nSome mixins need to process class extensions of their target class. To do this you can\ndefine an `extended` method like so:\n\n     Ext.define('Foo.bar.Util', {\n         extend: 'Ext.Mixin',\n\n         mixinConfig: {\n             extended: function(baseClass, derivedClass, classBody) {\n                 // This function is called whenever a new \"derivedClass\" is created\n                 // that extends a \"baseClass\" in to which this mixin was mixed.\n             }\n         }\n     });\n",

        "doc": "A mixin that provides the functionality for inheritable configs. This allows linking\ncomponents and containers via a prototype-chained object for accessing inherited\nvalues.\n\n## Getting Inherited Properties\n\nA component's inherited state is used to keep track of aspects of a component's state\nthat might be influenced by its ancestors like \"collapsed\" and \"hidden\". For example:\n\n     var hidden = this.getInheritedConfig('hidden');\n\nThe above will produce `true` if this or any ancestor component has its `hidden` config\nset to `true`.\n\n## Chained Objects\n\nInheritable properties are implemented by chaining each component's inherited state\nobject to its parent container's inherited state object via the prototype. The result\nis such that if a component's `inheritedState` does not have it's own property, it\ninherits the property from the nearest ancestor that does.\n\nIn the case of a Container, two state objects are created. The primary (\"outer\") object\nis used for reading inherited properties. It is also what a child will prototype chain\nto if that child is not part of the container's `items` collection. Anything in the\n`items` collection will chain to the inheritedStateInner object instead. This object is\nprototype chained to inheritedState but allows for Container's layout to set inherited\nproperties that specifically apply only to children of the container. This inner object\nis unlikely to be needed by user code.\n\n## Publishing Inherited Properties\n\nThe first step to publishing inherited properties is to override `{@link #method!initInheritedState initInheritedState}`\nand add properties that have inheritable values.\n\n     initInheritedState: function (inheritedState) {\n         this.callParent(arguments);\n\n         if (this.getHidden()) {\n             inheritedState.hidden = true;\n         }\n     }\n\nThe above is important because `{@link #method!initInheritedState initInheritedState}` is called whenever the object needs\nto be repopulated. As you can see, only `true` values are added to `inheritedState` in\nthis case because `false` would mask a `hidden` value of `true` from an ancestor.\n\nIf these values change dynamically, these properties must be maintained. For example:\n\n     updateHidden: function (hidden) {\n         var inherited = this.getInherited();\n\n         if (hidden) {\n             inherited.hidden = true;\n         } else {\n             // Unmask whatever may be inherited:\n             delete inherited.hidden;\n         }\n     }\n\n## Proper Usage\n\nALWAYS access inherited state using `{@link #method!getInherited getInherited}` or `{@link #method!getInheritedConfig getInheritedConfig}`, not by\naccessing `inheritedState` directly.\n\nThe `inheritedState` property does not exist until the first call to `{@link #method!getInherited getInherited}`. At\nthat point `{@link #method!getInherited getInherited}` walks up the component tree to establish the `inheritedState`\nprototype chain. Additionally the `inheritedState` property should NOT be relied upon\neven after the initial call to `{@link #method!getInherited getInherited}` because it is possible for it to become\ninvalid.\n\nInvalidation typically happens when a component is moved to a new container. In such a\ncase the `inheritedState` remains invalid until the next time `{@link #method!getInherited getInherited}` is called\non the component or one of its descendants.\n",

Some components override this and publish their most useful\nconfigs by default.\n\n**Note:** We'll discuss publishing properties **not** found in the config block below.\n\nValues determined to be invalid by component (often form fields and model validations)\nwill not be published to the ViewModel.\n\nThis config uses the `{@link #cfg-reference}` to determine the name of the data\nobject to place in the `ViewModel`. If `reference` is not set then this config\nis ignored.\n\nBy using this config and `{@link #cfg-reference}` you can bind configs between\ncomponents. For example:\n\n     ...\n         items: [{\n             xtype: 'textfield',\n             reference: 'somefield',  // component's name in the ViewModel\n             publishes: 'value' // value is not published by default\n         },{\n             ...\n         },{\n             xtype: 'displayfield',\n             bind: 'You have entered \"{somefield.value}\"'\n         }]\n     ...\n\nClasses must provide this config as an Object:\n\n     Ext.define('App.foo.Bar', {\n         publishes: {\n             foo: true,\n             bar: true\n         }\n     });\n\nThis is required for the config system to properly merge values from derived\nclasses.\n\nFor instances this value can be specified as a value as show above or an array\nor object as follows:\n\n     {\n         xtype: 'textfield',\n         reference: 'somefield',\n         publishes: [\n             'value',\n             'rawValue',\n             'dirty'\n         ]\n     }\n\n     // This achieves the same result as the above array form.\n     {\n         xtype: 'textfield',\n         reference: 'somefield',\n         publishes: {\n             value: true,\n             rawValue: true,\n             dirty: true\n         }\n     }\n\nIn some cases, users may want to publish a property to the viewModel that is not found\nin a class  config block. In these situations, you may utilize {@link #publishState}\nif the property has a  setter method. Let's use\n{@link Ext.form.Labelable#setFieldLabel setFieldLabel} as an example:\n\n      setFieldLabel: function(fieldLabel) {\n          this.callParent(arguments);\n          this.publishState('fieldLabel', fieldLabel);\n      }\n\nWith the above chunk of code, fieldLabel may now be published to the viewModel.\n",

By default, Panels use the {@link Ext.layout.container.Auto Auto} scheme. This simply\nrenders child components, appending them one after the other inside the Container,\nand **does not apply any sizing** at all.\n\n{@img Ext.panel.Panel/panel.png Panel components}\n\nA Panel may also contain {@link #bbar bottom} and {@link #tbar top} toolbars, along with separate\n{@link Ext.panel.Header header}, {@link #fbar footer} and body sections.\n\nPanel also provides built-in {@link #collapsible collapsible, expandable} and {@link #closable}\nbehavior. Panels can be easily dropped into any {@link Ext.container.Container Container}\nor layout, and the layout and rendering pipeline is\n{@link Ext.container.Container#method-add completely managed by the framework}.\n\n**Note:** By default, the `{@link #closable close}` header tool _destroys_ the Panel resulting\nin removal of the Panel and the destruction of any descendant Components. This makes the Panel\nobject, and all its descendants **unusable**. To enable the close tool to simply _hide_ a Panel\nfor later re-use, configure the Panel with `{@link #closeAction closeAction}: 'hide'`.\n\nUsually, Panels are used as constituents within an application, in which case, they would be used\nas child items of Containers, and would themselves use Ext.Components as child\n{@link #cfg-items}. However to illustrate simply rendering a Panel into the document,\nhere's how to do it:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', {\n        title: 'Hello',\n        width: 200,\n        html: '<p>World!</p>',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\nA more realistic scenario is a Panel created to house input fields which will not be rendered,\nbut used as a constituent part of a Container:\n\n    @example\n    var filterPanel = Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', {\n        bodyPadding: 5,  // Don't want content to crunch against the borders\n        width: 300,\n        title: 'Filters',\n        items: [{\n            xtype: 'datefield',\n            fieldLabel: 'Start date'\n        }, {\n            xtype: 'datefield',\n            fieldLabel: 'End date'\n        }],\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\nNote that the Panel above is configured to render into the document and assigned a size.\nIn a real world scenario, the Panel will often be added inside a Container which will use a\n{@link #layout} to render, size and position its child Components.\n\nPanels will often use specific {@link #layout}s to provide an application with shape\nand structure by containing and arranging child Components:\n\n    @example\n    var resultsPanel = Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', {\n        title: 'Results',\n        width: 600,\n        height: 400,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        layout: {\n            type: 'vbox',       // Arrange child items vertically\n            align: 'stretch',    // Each takes up full width\n            padding: 5\n        },\n        items: [{\n            // Results grid specified as a config object with an xtype of 'grid'\n            xtype: 'grid',\n            // One header just for show. There's no data\n            columns: [{header: 'Column One'}],\n            store: Ext.create('Ext.data.ArrayStore', {}), // A dummy empty data store\n            // Use 1/3 of Container's height (hint to Box layout)\n            flex: 1\n        }, {\n            xtype: 'splitter'   // A splitter between the two child items\n        }, {\n            // Details Panel specified as a config object (no xtype defaults to 'panel').\n            title: 'Details',\n            bodyPadding: 5,\n            items: [{\n                fieldLabel: 'Data item',\n                xtype: 'textfield'\n            }], // An array of form fields\n            flex: 2             // Use 2/3 of Container's height (hint to Box layout)\n        }]\n    });\n\nThe example illustrates one possible method of displaying search results.

If `{@link #cfg!reference reference}` is not set then this config\nis ignored.\n\nBy using this config and `{@link #cfg-reference}` you can bind configs between\ncomponents.

This\n should be set on things like the generated content for an `{@link Ext.view.View}`.\n- `{@link #event!select select}`: A selector that will be passed to {@link Ext.dom.Element#method-select}.\n- `selectNode`: A selector that will be passed to\n{@link Ext.dom.Element#method-selectNode}.\n\nFor example:\n\n     childEls: {\n         button: true,\n         buttonText: 'text',\n         buttonImage: {\n             itemId: 'image'\n         }\n     }\n\nThe above is translated into the following complete form:\n\n     childEls: {\n         button: {\n             name: 'button',\n             itemId: 'button'\n         },\n         buttonText: {\n             name: 'buttonText',\n             itemId: 'text'\n         },\n         buttonImage: {\n             name: 'buttonImage',\n             itemId: 'image'\n         }\n     }\n\nThe above can be provided as an array like so:\n\n     childEls: [\n         'button',\n         { name: 'buttonText', itemId: 'text' },\n         { name: 'buttonImage', itemId: 'image' }\n     }\n\nFor example, a Component which renders a title and body text:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.Component', {\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        renderTpl: [\n            '<h1 id=\"{id}-title\" data-ref=\"title\">{title}</h1>',\n            '<p>{msg}</p>',\n        ],\n        renderData: {\n            title: \"Error\",\n            msg: \"Something went wrong\"\n        },\n        childEls: [\"title\"],\n        listeners: {\n            afterrender: function(cmp){\n                // After rendering the component will have a title property\n                cmp.title.setStyle({color: \"red\"});\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n**Note:** `childEl`s in the {@link Ext.Component#cfg-renderTpl renderTpl}\nmust be referenced in a **data-ref** attribute.

This\n should be set on things like the generated content for an `{@link Ext.view.View}`.\n- `{@link #event!select select}`: A selector that will be passed to {@link Ext.dom.Element#method-select}.\n- `selectNode`: A selector that will be passed to\n{@link Ext.dom.Element#method-selectNode}.\n\nFor example:\n\n     childEls: {\n         button: true,\n         buttonText: 'text',\n         buttonImage: {\n             itemId: 'image'\n         }\n     }\n\nThe above is translated into the following complete form:\n\n     childEls: {\n         button: {\n             name: 'button',\n             itemId: 'button'\n         },\n         buttonText: {\n             name: 'buttonText',\n             itemId: 'text'\n         },\n         buttonImage: {\n             name: 'buttonImage',\n             itemId: 'image'\n         }\n     }\n\nThe above can be provided as an array like so:\n\n     childEls: [\n         'button',\n         { name: 'buttonText', itemId: 'text' },\n         { name: 'buttonImage', itemId: 'image' }\n     }\n\nFor example, a Component which renders a title and body text:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.Component', {\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        renderTpl: [\n            '<h1 id=\"{id}-title\" data-ref=\"title\">{title}</h1>',\n            '<p>{msg}</p>',\n        ],\n        renderData: {\n            title: \"Error\",\n            msg: \"Something went wrong\"\n        },\n        childEls: [\"title\"],\n        listeners: {\n            afterrender: function(cmp){\n                // After rendering the component will have a title property\n                cmp.title.setStyle({color: \"red\"});\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n**Note:** `childEl`s in the {@link Ext.Component#cfg-renderTpl renderTpl}\nmust be referenced in a **data-ref** attribute.

As an abstract class,\napplications use derived classes such as `{@link Ext.grid.plugin.Clipboard}` instead\nand seldom use this class directly.\n\n## Operation\n\nComponents that interact with the clipboard do so in two directions: copy and paste.\nWhen copying to the clipboard, a component will often provide multiple data formats.\nOn paste, the consumer of the data can then decide what format it prefers and ignore\nthe others.\n\n### Copy (and Cut)\n\nThere are two storage locations provided for holding copied data:\n\n * The system clipboard, used to exchange data with other applications running\n   outside the browser.\n * A memory space in the browser page that can hold data for use only by other\n   components on the page. This allows for richer formats to be transferred.\n\nA component can copy (or cut) data in multiple formats as controlled by the\n`{@link #cfg-memory}` and `{@link #cfg-system}` configs.\n\n### Paste\n\nWhile there may be many formats available, when a component is ready to paste, only\none format can ultimately be used. This is specified by the `{@link #cfg-source}`\nconfig.\n\n## Browser Limitations\n\nAt the current time, browsers have only a limited ability to interact with the system\nclipboard. The only reliable, cross-browser, plugin-in-free technique for doing so is\nto use invisible elements and focus tricks **during** the processing of clipboard key\npresses like CTRL+C (on Windows/Linux) or CMD+C (on Mac).\n",

Those callbacks\ncan subsequently transform the value that was resolved or the reason that was rejected.\nEach call to `{@link #method!then then}` returns a new Promise of that transformed value; i.e., a Promise\nthat is resolved with the callback return value or rejected with any error thrown by\nthe callback.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n     this.companyService.loadCompanies().then(\n         function(records) {\n             // Do something with result.\n         },\n         function(error) {\n             // Do something on failure.\n         }).\n     always(function() {\n         // Do something whether call succeeded or failed\n     });\n\nThe above code uses the `Promise` returned from the `companyService.loadCompanies()`\nmethod and uses `then()` to attach success and failure handlers. Finally, an `always()`\nmethod call is chained onto the returned promise. This specifies a callback function\nthat will run whether the underlying call succeeded or failed.\n\nSee `{@link Ext.Deferred}` for an example of using the returned Promise.\n\n[1]: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts#april_14_2015_rev_38_final_draft\n",

                "doc": "\nAn object of routes to handle hash changes. A route can be defined in a simple way:\n\n    routes: {\n        'foo/bar': 'handleFoo',\n        'user/:id': 'showUser'\n    }\n\nWhere the property is the hash (which can accept a parameter defined by a colon)\nand the value is the method on the controller to execute. The parameters will get sent\nin the action method.\n\nIf no routes match a given hash, an {@link Ext.GlobalEvents#unmatchedroute} event\nwill be fired. This can be listened to in four ways:\n\n    Ext.on('unmatchedroute', function(token) {});\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.controller.Foo', {\n        extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',\n\n        listen: {\n            global: {\n                unmatchedroute: 'onUnmatchedRoute'\n            }\n        },\n\n        onUnmatchedRoute: function(token) {}\n    });\n\n    Ext.application({\n        name: 'MyApp',\n\n        listen: {\n            global: {\n                unmatchedroute: 'onUnmatchedRoute'\n            }\n        },\n\n        onUnmatchedRoute: function(token) {}\n    });\n\n    Ext.application({\n        name: 'MyApp',\n\n        listeners: {\n            unmatchedroute: 'onUnmatchedRoute'\n        },\n\n        onUnmatchedRoute: function(token) {}\n    });\n\nThere is also a complex means of defining a route where you can use a before action\nand even specify your own RegEx for the parameter:\n\n    routes: {\n        'foo/bar': {\n            action: 'handleFoo',\n            before: 'beforeHandleFoo'\n        },\n        'user/:id': {\n            action: 'showUser',\n            before: 'beforeShowUser',\n            conditions: {\n                ':id': '([0-9]+)'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nThis will only match if the `id` parameter is a number.\n\nThe before action allows you to cancel an action. Every before action will get passed\nan `action` argument with a `resume` and `stop` methods as the last argument of the\nmethod and you *MUST* execute either method:\n\n    beforeHandleFoo: function (action) {\n        // some logic here\n\n        // this will allow the handleFoo action to be executed\n        action.resume();\n    },\n    handleFoo: function () {\n        // will get executed due to true being passed in callback in beforeHandleFoo\n    },\n    beforeShowUser: function (id, action) {\n        // allows for async process like an Ajax\n        Ext.Ajax.request({\n            url: 'foo.php',\n            success: function () {\n                // will not allow the showUser method to be executed\n                // but will continue other queued actions.\n                action.stop();\n            },\n            failure: function () {\n                // will not allow the showUser method to be executed\n                // and will not allow other queued actions to be executed.\n                action.stop(true);\n            }\n        });\n    },\n    showUser: function (id) {\n        // will not get executed due to false being passed in callback in beforeShowUser\n    }\n\nYou **MUST** execute the `{@link Ext.route.Action#resume resume}` or\n`{@link Ext.route.Action#stop stop}` method on the `action` argument. Executing\n`action.resume();` will continue the action, `action.stop();` will prevent\nfurther execution.\n\nThe default RegEx that will be used is `([%a-zA-Z0-9\\\\-\\\\_\\\\s,]+)` but you can specify\nany that may suit what you need to accomplish. An example of an advanced condition\nmay be to make a parameter optional and case-insensitive:\n\n    routes: {\n        'user:id': {\n            action: 'showUser',\n            before: 'beforeShowUser',\n            conditions: {\n                ':id': '(?:(?:\\/){1}([%a-z0-9_,\\s\\-]+))?'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nEach route can be named; this allows for the route to be looked up by name instead of\nurl. By default, the route's name will be the url you configure but you can provide\nthe `{@link Ext.route.Route#name name}` config to override the default:\n\n    routes: {\n        'user:id': {\n            action: 'showUser',\n            before: 'beforeShowUser',\n            name: 'user',\n            conditions: {\n                ':id': '(?:(?:\\/){1}([%a-z0-9_,\\s\\-]+))?'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nThe `user:id` route can not be looked up via the `user` name which is useful when using\n`{@link #redirectTo}`.\n\nA wildcard route can also be defined which works exactly like any other route but will\nalways execute before any other route.  To specify a wildcard route, use the `*`\nas the url:\n\n    routes: {\n        '*': 'onToken'\n    }\n\nSince a wildcard route will execute before any other route, it can delay the execution\nof other routes allowing for such things like a user session to be retrieved:\n\n    routes: {\n        '*': {\n            before: 'onBeforeToken'\n        }\n    },\n\n    onBeforeToken: function () {\n        return Ext.Ajax.request({\n            url: '/user/session'\n        });\n    }\n\nIn the above example, no other route will execute unless that\n{@link Ext.Ajax#request request} returns successfully.\n\nYou can also use a wildcard route if you need to defer routes until a store has been\nloaded when an application first starts up:\n\n    routes: {\n        '*': {\n            before: 'onBeforeToken'\n        }\n    },\n\n    onBeforeToken: function (action) {\n        var store = Ext.getStore('Settings');\n\n        if (store.loaded) {\n            action.resume();\n        } else {\n            store.on('load', action.resume, action, { single: true });\n        }\n    }\n\nThe valid options are configurations from {@link Ext.route.Handler} and\n{@link Ext.route.Route}.\n",

If a type is not provided, it will use\nthe {@link #defaultMatcher default matcher}.\n\nFor more on types, see the {@link #cfg!types} config.\n\nFor backwards compatibility, there is `positional` mode which is like\n`named` mode but how you define the url parameters and how they are passed\nto the action and before handlers is slightly different:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.view.main.MainController', {\n        extend: 'Ext.app.ViewController',\n        alias: 'controller.app-main',\n\n        routes: {\n            'user/:id:action': {\n                action: 'onUser',\n                before: 'onBeforeUser',\n                name: 'user',\n                conditions: {\n                    ':action': '(edit|delete)?'\n                }\n            }\n        },\n\n        onBeforeUser: function (id, action) {\n            return Ext.Ajax\n                .request({\n                    url: '/check/permission',\n                    params: {\n                        route: 'user',\n                        meta: {\n                            action: action,\n                            id: id\n                        }\n                    }\n                });\n        },\n\n        onUser: function (id) {\n            // ...\n        }\n    });\n\nThe parameters are defined without curly braces (`:id`, `:action`) and\nthey are passed as individual arguments to the action and before handlers.\n\nIt's important to note you cannot mix positional and named parameter formats\nin the same route since how they are passed to the handlers is different.\n\nRoutes can define sections of a route pattern that are optional by surrounding\nthe section that is to be optional with parenthesis. For example, if a route\nshould match both `#user` and `#user/1234` to either show a grid of all users\nor details or a single user, you can define the route such as:\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.view.main.MainController', {\n        extend: 'Ext.app.ViewController',\n        alias: 'controller.app-main',\n\n        routes: {\n            'user(/:{id:num})': {\n                action: 'onUser',\n                name: 'user'\n            }\n        },\n\n        onUser: function (params) {\n            if (params.id) {\n                // load user details\n            } else {\n                // load grid of users\n            }\n        }\n    });\n",

TabPanels can be used exactly like a standard {@link Ext.panel.Panel} for\nlayout purposes, but also have special support for containing child Components\n(`{@link Ext.container.Container#cfg-items items}`) that are managed using a\n{@link Ext.layout.container.Card CardLayout layout manager}, and displayed as separate tabs.\n\n**Note:** By default, a tab's close tool _destroys_ the child tab Component and all its\ndescendants. This makes the child tab Component, and all its descendants **unusable**.\nTo enable re-use of a tab, configure the TabPanel with `{@link #autoDestroy autoDestroy: false}`.\n\n## TabPanel's layout\n\nTabPanels use a Dock layout to position the {@link Ext.tab.Bar TabBar} at the top of the widget.\nPanels added to the TabPanel will have their header hidden by default because the Tab will\nautomatically take the Panel's configured title and icon.\n\nTabPanels use their {@link Ext.panel.Header header} or {@link Ext.panel.Panel#fbar footer}\nelement (depending on the {@link #tabPosition} configuration) to accommodate the tab selector\nbuttons. This means that a TabPanel will not display any configured title, and will not display\nany configured header {@link Ext.panel.Panel#tools tools}.\n\nTo display a header, embed the TabPanel in a {@link Ext.panel.Panel Panel} which uses\n`{@link Ext.container.Container#layout layout: 'fit'}`.\n\n## Controlling tabs\n\nConfiguration options for the {@link Ext.tab.Tab} that represents the component can be passed in\nby specifying the tabConfig option:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.tip.QuickTipManager.init();\n    Ext.create('Ext.tab.Panel', {\n        width: 400,\n        height: 400,\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        items: [{\n            title: 'Foo'\n        }, {\n            title: 'Bar',\n            tabConfig: {\n                title: 'Custom Title',\n                tooltip: 'A button tooltip'\n            }\n        }]\n    });\n\n## Vetoing Changes\n\nUser interaction when changing the tabs can be vetoed by listening to the\n{@link #beforetabchange} event. By returning `false`, the tab change will not occur.\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.tab.Panel', {\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        width: 200,\n        height: 200,\n        listeners: {\n            beforetabchange: function(tabs, newTab, oldTab) {\n                return newTab.title != 'P2';\n            }\n        },\n        items: [{\n            title: 'P1'\n        }, {\n            title: 'P2'\n        }, {\n            title: 'P3'\n        }]\n    });\n\n# Examples\n\nHere is a basic TabPanel rendered to the body. This also shows the useful configuration\n{@link #activeTab}, which allows you to set the active tab on render.\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.tab.Panel', {\n        width: 300,\n        height: 200,\n        activeTab: 0,\n        items: [\n            {\n                title: 'Tab 1',\n                bodyPadding: 10,\n                html : 'A simple tab'\n            },\n            {\n                title: 'Tab 2',\n                html : 'Another one'\n            }\n        ],\n        renderTo : Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\nIt is easy to control the visibility of items in the tab bar. Specify hidden: true to have the\ntab button hidden initially. Items can be subsequently hidden and show by accessing the\ntab property on the child item.\n\n    @example\n    var tabs = Ext.create('Ext.tab.Panel', {\n        width: 400,\n        height: 400,\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        items: [{\n            title: 'Home',\n            html: 'Home',\n            itemId: 'home'\n        }, {\n            title: 'Users',\n            html: 'Users',\n            itemId: 'users',\n            hidden: true\n        }, {\n            title: 'Tickets',\n            html: 'Tickets',\n            itemId: 'tickets'\n        }]\n    });\n\n    Ext.defer(function(){\n        tabs.child('#home').tab.hide();\n        var users = tabs.child('#users');\n        users.tab.show();\n        tabs.setActiveTab(users);\n    }, 1000);\n\nYou can remove the background of the TabBar by setting the {@link #plain} property to `true`.\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.tab.Panel', {\n        width: 300,\n        height: 200,\n        activeTab: 0,\n        plain: true,\n        items: [\n            {\n                title: 'Tab 1',\n                bodyPadding: 10,\n                html : 'A simple tab'\n            },\n            {\n                title: 'Tab 2',\n                html : 'Another one'\n            }\n        ],\n        renderTo : Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\nAnother useful configuration of TabPanel is {@link #tabPosition}. This allows you to change the\nposition where the tabs are displayed. The available options for this are `'top'` (default) and\n`'bottom'`.\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.tab.Panel', {\n        width: 300,\n        height: 200,\n        activeTab: 0,\n        bodyPadding: 10,\n        tabPosition: 'bottom',\n        items: [\n            {\n                title: 'Tab 1',\n                html : 'A simple tab'\n            },\n            {\n                title: 'Tab 2',\n                html : 'Another one'\n            }\n        ],\n        renderTo : Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\nThe {@link #setActiveTab} is a very useful method in TabPanel which will allow you to change the\ncurrent active tab. You can either give it an index or an instance of a tab. For example:\n\n    @example\n    var tabs = Ext.create('Ext.tab.Panel', {\n        items: [\n            {\n                id   : 'my-tab',\n                title: 'Tab 1',\n                html : 'A simple tab'\n            },\n            {\n                title: 'Tab 2',\n                html : 'Another one'\n            }\n        ],\n        renderTo : Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\n    var tab = Ext.getCmp('my-tab');\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.button.Button', {\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        text    : 'Select the first tab',\n        scope   : this,\n        handler : function() {\n            tabs.setActiveTab(tab);\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.button.Button', {\n        text    : 'Select the second tab',\n        scope   : this,\n        handler : function() {\n            tabs.setActiveTab(1);\n        },\n        renderTo : Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\nThe {@link #getActiveTab} is a another useful method in TabPanel which will return the current\nactive tab.\n\n    @example\n    var tabs = Ext.create('Ext.tab.Panel', {\n        items: [\n            {\n                title: 'Tab 1',\n                html : 'A simple tab'\n            },\n            {\n                title: 'Tab 2',\n                html : 'Another one'\n            }\n        ],\n        renderTo : Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.button.Button', {\n        text    : 'Get active tab',\n        scope   : this,\n        handler : function() {\n            var tab = tabs.getActiveTab();\n            alert('Current tab: ' + tab.title);\n        },\n        renderTo : Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\nAdding a new tab is very simple with a TabPanel. You simple call the {@link #method-add} method\nwith an config object for a panel.\n\n    @example\n    var tabs = Ext.create('Ext.tab.Panel', {\n        items: [\n            {\n                title: 'Tab 1',\n                html : 'A simple tab'\n            },\n            {\n                title: 'Tab 2',\n                html : 'Another one'\n            }\n        ],\n        renderTo : Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.button.Button', {\n        text    : 'New tab',\n        scope   : this,\n        handler : function() {\n            var tab = tabs.add({\n                // we use the tabs.items property to get the length of current items/tabs\n                title: 'Tab ' + (tabs.items.length + 1),\n                html : 'Another one'\n            });\n\n            tabs.setActiveTab(tab);\n        },\n        renderTo : Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\nAdditionally, removing a tab is very also simple with a TabPanel. You simple call the\n{@link #method-remove} method with an config object for a panel.\n\n    @example\n    var tabs = Ext.create('Ext.tab.Panel', {\n        items: [\n            {\n                title: 'Tab 1',\n                html : 'A simple tab'\n            },\n            {\n                id   : 'remove-this-tab',\n                title: 'Tab 2',\n                html : 'Another one'\n            }\n        ],\n        renderTo : Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.button.Button', {\n        text    : 'Remove tab',\n        scope   : this,\n        handler : function() {\n            var tab = Ext.getCmp('remove-this-tab');\n            tabs.remove(tab);\n        },\n        renderTo : Ext.getBody()\n    });\n",

        "doc": "ToolTip is a {@link Ext.tip.Tip} implementation that handles the common case of displaying a\ntooltip when hovering over a certain element or elements on the page. It allows fine-grained\ncontrol over the tooltip's alignment relative to the target element or mouse, and the timing\nof when it is automatically shown and hidden.\n\nThis implementation does **not** have a built-in method of automatically populating the tooltip's\ntext based on the target element; you must either configure a fixed {@link #html} value for each\nToolTip instance, or implement custom logic (e.g. in a {@link #beforeshow} event listener) to\ngenerate the appropriate tooltip content on the fly. See {@link Ext.tip.QuickTip} for a more\nconvenient way of automatically populating and configuring a tooltip based on specific DOM\nattributes of each target element.\n\n# Basic Example\n\n    @example\n    Ext.getBody().appendChild({\n        id: 'clearButton',\n        html: 'Clear Button',\n        style: 'display:inline-block;background:#A2C841;padding:7px;cursor:pointer;'\n    });\n\n    var tip = Ext.create('Ext.tip.ToolTip', {\n        target: 'clearButton',\n        html: 'Press this button to clear the form'\n    });\n\n# Delegation\n\nIn addition to attaching a ToolTip to a single element, you can also use delegation to attach\none ToolTip to many elements under a common parent. This is more efficient than creating many\nToolTip instances. To do this, point the {@link #target} config to a common ancestor of all the\nelements, and then set the {@link #delegate} config to a CSS selector that will select all the\nappropriate sub-elements.\n\nWhen using delegation, it is likely that you will want to programmatically change the content\nof the ToolTip based on each delegate element; you can do this by implementing a custom\nlistener for the {@link #beforeshow} event. Example:\n\n    @example\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.ArrayStore', {\n        fields: ['company', 'price', 'change'],\n        data: [\n            ['3m Co',                               71.72, 0.02],\n            ['Alcoa Inc',                           29.01, 0.42],\n            ['Altria Group Inc',                    83.81, 0.28],\n            ['American Express Company',            52.55, 0.01],\n            ['American International Group, Inc.',  64.13, 0.31],\n            ['AT&T Inc.',                           31.61, -0.48]\n        ]\n    });\n\n    var grid = Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {\n        title: 'Array Grid',\n        store: store,\n        columns: [\n            {text: 'Company', flex: 1, dataIndex: 'company'},\n            {text: 'Price', width: 75, dataIndex: 'price'},\n            {text: 'Change', width: 75, dataIndex: 'change'}\n        ],\n        height: 200,\n        width: 400,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\n    var view = grid.getView();\n    var tip = Ext.create('Ext.tip.ToolTip', {\n        // The overall target element.\n        target: view.el,\n        // Each grid row causes its own separate show and hide.\n        delegate: view.itemSelector,\n        // Moving within the row should not hide the tip.\n        trackMouse: true,\n        // Render immediately so that tip.body can be referenced prior to the first show.\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        listeners: {\n            // Change content dynamically depending on which element triggered the show.\n            beforeshow: function updateTipBody(tip) {\n                tip.update('Over company \"' + view.getRecord(tip.triggerElement).get('company') +\n                           '\"');\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n# Alignment\n\nThe following configuration properties allow control over how the ToolTip is aligned relative to\nthe target element and/or mouse pointer:\n\n- {@link #anchor}\n- {@link #anchorToTarget}\n- {@link #trackMouse}\n- {@link #mouseOffset}\n\n# Showing/Hiding\n\nThe following configuration properties allow control over how and when the ToolTip\nis automatically shown and hidden:\n\n- {@link #autoHide}\n- {@link #showDelay}\n- {@link #hideDelay}\n- {@link #dismissDelay}\n",

Using this config anchors the ToolTip to its target\ninstead.\n\nThis may take the following forms:\n\n- **Blank**: Defaults to aligning the element's top-left corner to the target's\n  bottom-left corner (\"tl-bl\").\n- **Two anchors**: If two values from the table below are passed separated by a dash,\n  the first value is used as the element's anchor point, and the second value is\n  used as the target's anchor point.\n- **Two edge/offset descriptors:** An edge/offset descriptor is an edge initial\n  (`t`/`r`/`b`/`l`) followed by a percentage along that side. This describes a\n  point to align with a similar point in the target. So `'t0-b0'` would be\n  the same as `'tl-bl'`, `'l0-r50'` would place the top left corner of this item\n  halfway down the right edge of the target item.

        "doc": "The TreePanel provides tree-structured UI representation of tree-structured data.\nA TreePanel must be bound to a {@link Ext.data.TreeStore}.\n\nTreePanels support multiple columns through the {@link #columns} configuration.\n\nBy default a TreePanel contains a single column which uses the `text` Field of\nthe store's nodes.\n\nSimple TreePanel using inline data:\n\n    @example\n    var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.TreeStore', {\n        root: {\n            expanded: true,\n            children: [\n                { text: 'detention', leaf: true },\n                { text: 'homework', expanded: true, children: [\n                    { text: 'book report', leaf: true },\n                    { text: 'algebra', leaf: true}\n                ] },\n                { text: 'buy lottery tickets', leaf: true }\n            ]\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.tree.Panel', {\n        title: 'Simple Tree',\n        width: 200,\n        height: 200,\n        store: store,\n        rootVisible: false,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody()\n    });\n\nFor the tree node config options (like `text`, `leaf`, `expanded`), see the documentation of\n{@link Ext.data.NodeInterface NodeInterface} config options.\n\nUnless the TreeStore is configured with a {@link Ext.data.Model model} of your choosing,\nnodes in the {@link Ext.data.TreeStore} are by default, instances of {@link Ext.data.TreeModel}.\n\n# Heterogeneous node types.\n\nIf the tree needs to use different data model classes at different levels there is much\nflexibility in how to specify this.\n\n### Configuring the Reader.\nIf you configure the proxy's reader with a\n{@link Ext.data.reader.Reader#typeProperty typeProperty}, then the server is in control of which\ndata model types are created. A discriminator field is used in the raw data to decide which class\nto instantiate. **If this is configured, then the data from the server is prioritized over other\nways of determining node class**.\n\n    @example\n    Ext.define('myApp.Territory', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.TreeModel',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'text',\n            mapping: 'name'\n        }]\n    });\n    Ext.define('myApp.Country', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.TreeModel',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'text',\n            mapping: 'name'\n        }]\n    });\n    Ext.define('myApp.City', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.TreeModel',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'text',\n            mapping: 'name'\n        }]\n    });\n    Ext.create('Ext.tree.Panel', {\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        height: 200,\n        width: 400,\n        title: 'Sales Areas - using typeProperty',\n        rootVisible: false,\n        store: {\n            // Child types use namespace of store's model by default\n            model: 'myApp.Territory',\n            proxy: {\n                type: 'memory',\n                reader: {\n                    typeProperty: 'mtype'\n                }\n            },\n            root: {\n                children: [{\n                    name: 'Europe, ME, Africa',\n                    mtype: 'Territory',\n                    children: [{\n                        name: 'UK of GB & NI',\n                        mtype: 'Country',\n                        children: [{\n                            name: 'London',\n                            mtype: 'City',\n                            leaf: true\n                        }]\n                    }]\n                }, {\n                    name: 'North America',\n                    mtype: 'Territory',\n                    children: [{\n                        name: 'USA',\n                        mtype: 'Country',\n                        children: [{\n                            name: 'Redwood City',\n                            mtype: 'City',\n                            leaf: true\n                        }]\n                    }]\n                }]\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n### Node being loaded decides.\nYou can declare your TreeModel subclasses with a {@link Ext.data.TreeModel#childType childType}\nwhich means that the node being loaded decides the class to instantiate for all of its\nchild nodes.\n\nIt is important to note that if the root node is {@link Ext.tree.Panel#rootVisible hidden},\nits type will default to the store's model type, and if left as the default\n(`{@link Ext.data.TreeModel}`) this will have no knowledge of creation of special child node\ntypes. So be sure to specify a store model in this case:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.define('myApp.TerritoryRoot', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.TreeModel',\n        childType: 'myApp.Territory',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'text',\n            mapping: 'name'\n        }]\n    });\n    Ext.define('myApp.Territory', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.TreeModel',\n        childType: 'myApp.Country',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'text',\n            mapping: 'name'\n        }]\n    });\n    Ext.define('myApp.Country', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.TreeModel',\n        childType: 'myApp.City',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'text',\n            mapping: 'name'\n        }]\n    });\n    Ext.define('myApp.City', {\n        extend: 'Ext.data.TreeModel',\n        fields: [{\n            name: 'text',\n            mapping: 'name'\n        }]\n    });\n    Ext.create('Ext.tree.Panel', {\n        renderTo: document.body,\n        height: 200,\n        width: 400,\n        title: 'Sales Areas',\n        rootVisible: false,\n        store: {\n            // Needs to be this so it knows to create 'Country' child nodes\n            model: 'myApp.TerritoryRoot',\n            root: {\n                children: [{\n                    name: 'Europe, ME, Africa',\n                    children: [{\n                        name: 'UK of GB & NI',\n                        children: [{\n                            name: 'London',\n                            leaf: true\n                        }]\n                    }]\n                }, {\n                    name: 'North America',\n                    children: [{\n                        name: 'USA',\n                        children: [{\n                            name: 'Redwood City',\n                            leaf: true\n                        }]\n                    }]\n                }]\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n# Data structure\n\nThe {@link Ext.data.TreeStore TreeStore} maintains a {@link Ext.data.TreeStore#getRoot root node}\nand a hierarchical structure of {@link Ext.data.TreeModel node}s.\n\nThe {@link Ext.tree.View UI} of the tree is driven by a {Ext.data.NodeStore NodeStore} which is\na flattened view of *visible* nodes. The NodeStore is dynamically updated to reflect\nthe visibility state of nodes as nodes are added, removed or expanded. The UI responds\nto mutation events fire by the NodeStore.\n\nNote that nodes have several more {@link Ext.data.Model#cfg-fields fields} in order to describe\ntheir state within the hierarchy.\n\nIf you add store listeners to the {@link Ext.data.Store#event-update update} event, then you will\nreceive notification when any of this state changes. You should check the array of modified field\nnames passed to the listener to decide whether the listener should take action\nor ignore the event.\n\n# Tree Grid\nTrees may be configured using the {@link #cfg-columns} config including a\n{@link Ext.tree.Column treecolumn} to give the tree panel a hybrid tree /\n{@link Ext.grid.Panel grid} structure.\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create({\n        xtype: 'treepanel',\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        height: 200,\n        width: 300,\n        rootVisible: false,\n        store: Ext.create('Ext.data.TreeStore', {\n            fields: ['text', 'duration', 'isLayover'],\n            root: {\n                expanded: true,\n                children: [{\n                    text: 'SFO  &nbsp;✈&nbsp; DFW',\n                    duration: '6h 55m',\n                    expanded: true,\n                    children: [{\n                        text: 'SFO &nbsp;✈&nbsp; PHX',\n                        duration: '2h 04m',\n                        leaf: true\n                    }, {\n                        text: 'PHX layover',\n                        duration: '2h 36m',\n                        isLayover: true,\n                        leaf: true\n                    }, {\n                        text: 'PHX &nbsp;✈&nbsp; DFW',\n                        duration: '2h 15m',\n                        leaf: true\n                    }]\n                }]\n            }\n        }),\n        columns: [{\n            xtype: 'treecolumn',\n            text: 'Flight Endpoints',\n            dataIndex: 'text',\n            flex: 1,\n            renderer: function (val, meta, rec) {\n                if (rec.get('isLayover')) {\n                    meta.tdStyle = 'color: gray; font-style: italic;';\n                }\n                return val;\n            }\n        }, {\n            text: 'Duration',\n            dataIndex: 'duration',\n            width: 100\n        }]\n    });\n",

This class is used as a mixin and currently applied to {@link Ext.dom.Element},\n{@link Ext.CompositeElement}, {@link Ext.draw.sprite.Sprite}, {@link Ext.draw.sprite.Composite},\nand {@link Ext.Component}.  Note that Components have a limited subset of what attributes\ncan be animated such as top, left, x, y, height, width, and opacity (color, paddings,\nand margins can not be animated).\n\n## Animation Basics\n\nAll animations require three things - `easing`, `duration`, and `to` (the final end value\nfor each property) you wish to animate. Easing and duration are defaulted values specified below.\nEasing describes how the intermediate values used during a transition will be calculated.\n{@link Ext.fx.Anim#easing Easing} allows for a transition to change speed over its duration.\nYou may use the defaults for easing and duration, but you must always set a\n{@link Ext.fx.Anim#to to} property which is the end value for all animations.\n\nPopular element 'to' configurations are:\n\n - opacity\n - x\n - y\n - color\n - height\n - width\n\nPopular sprite 'to' configurations are:\n\n - translation\n - path\n - scale\n - stroke\n - rotation\n\nThe default duration for animations is 250 (which is a 1/4 of a second).  Duration is denoted in\nmilliseconds.  Therefore 1 second is 1000, 1 minute would be 60000, and so on. The default\neasing curve used for all animations is 'ease'.  Popular easing functions are included\nand can be found in {@link Ext.fx.Anim#easing Easing}.\n\nFor example, a simple animation to fade out an element with a default easing and duration:\n\n    var p1 = Ext.get('myElementId');\n\n    p1.animate({\n        to: {\n            opacity: 0\n        }\n    });\n\nTo make this animation fade out in a tenth of a second:\n\n    var p1 = Ext.get('myElementId');\n\n    p1.animate({\n       duration: 100,\n        to: {\n            opacity: 0\n        }\n    });\n\n## Animation Queues\n\nBy default all animations are added to a queue which allows for animation via a chain-style API.\nFor example, the following code will queue 4 animations which occur sequentially (one right\nafter the other):\n\n    p1.animate({\n        to: {\n            x: 500\n        }\n    }).animate({\n        to: {\n            y: 150\n        }\n    }).animate({\n        to: {\n            backgroundColor: '#f00'  //red\n        }\n    }).animate({\n        to: {\n            opacity: 0\n        }\n    });\n\nYou can change this behavior by calling the {@link Ext.util.Animate#syncFx syncFx} method and all\nsubsequent animations for the specified target will be run concurrently (at the same time).\n\n    p1.syncFx();  //this will make all animations run at the same time\n\n    p1.animate({\n        to: {\n            x: 500\n        }\n    }).animate({\n        to: {\n            y: 150\n        }\n    }).animate({\n        to: {\n            backgroundColor: '#f00'  //red\n        }\n    }).animate({\n        to: {\n            opacity: 0\n        }\n    });\n\nThis works the same as:\n\n    p1.animate({\n        to: {\n            x: 500,\n            y: 150,\n            backgroundColor: '#f00'  //red\n            opacity: 0\n        }\n    });\n\nThe {@link Ext.util.Animate#stopAnimation stopAnimation} method can be used to stop any\ncurrently running animations and clear any queued animations.\n\n## Animation Keyframes\n\nYou can also set up complex animations with {@link Ext.fx.Anim#keyframes keyframes} which follow\nthe CSS3 Animation configuration pattern. Note rotation, translation, and scaling can only\nbe done for sprites. The previous example can be written with the following syntax:\n\n    p1.animate({\n        duration: 1000,  //one second total\n        keyframes: {\n            25: {     //from 0 to 250ms (25%)\n                x: 0\n            },\n            50: {   //from 250ms to 500ms (50%)\n                y: 0\n            },\n            75: {  //from 500ms to 750ms (75%)\n                backgroundColor: '#f00'  //red\n            },\n            100: {  //from 750ms to 1sec\n                opacity: 0\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n## Animation Events\n\nEach animation you create has events for {@link Ext.fx.Anim#beforeanimate beforeanimate},\n{@link Ext.fx.Anim#afteranimate afteranimate}, and {@link Ext.fx.Anim#lastframe lastframe}.\nKeyframed animations adds an additional {@link Ext.fx.Animator#keyframe keyframe} event which\nfires for each keyframe in your animation.\n\nAll animations support the {@link Ext.util.Observable#listeners listeners} configuration\nto attact functions to these events.\n\n    startAnimate: function() {\n        var p1 = Ext.get('myElementId');\n        p1.animate({\n           duration: 100,\n            to: {\n                opacity: 0\n            },\n            listeners: {\n                beforeanimate:  function() {\n                    // Execute my custom method before the animation\n                    this.myBeforeAnimateFn();\n                },\n                afteranimate: function() {\n                    // Execute my custom method after the animation\n                    this.myAfterAnimateFn();\n                },\n                scope: this\n        });\n    },\n    myBeforeAnimateFn: function() {\n      // My custom logic\n    },\n    myAfterAnimateFn: function() {\n      // My custom logic\n    }\n\nDue to the fact that animations run asynchronously, you can determine if an animation\nis currently running on any target by using the\n{@link Ext.util.Animate#getActiveAnimation getActiveAnimation} method. This method will return\nfalse if there are no active animations or return the currently running {@link Ext.fx.Anim}\ninstance.\n\nIn this example, we're going to wait for the current animation to finish, then stop any other\nqueued animations before we fade our element's opacity to 0:\n\n    var curAnim = p1.getActiveAnimation();\n    if (curAnim) {\n        curAnim.on('afteranimate', function() {\n            p1.stopAnimation();\n            p1.animate({\n                to: {\n                    opacity: 0\n                }\n            });\n        });\n    }\n",

To enable this\nthere is the `{@link #cfg!extraKeys extraKeys}` config.\n\nFor example, to quickly look up items by their \"name\" property:\n\n     var collection = new Ext.util.Collection({\n         extraKeys: {\n             byName: 'name' // based on \"name\" property of each item\n         }\n     });\n\n## Ranges\n\nWhen methods accept index arguments to indicate a range of items, these are either an\nindex and a number of items or a \"begin\" and \"end\" index.\n\nIn the case of \"begin\" and \"end\", the \"end\" is the first item outside the range. This\ndefinition makes it simple to expression empty ranges because \"length = end - begin\".\n\n### Negative Indices\n\nWhen an item index is provided, negative values are treated as offsets from the end of\nthe collection. In other words the follow are equivalent:\n\n     +---+---+---+---+---+---+\n     |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n     +---+---+---+---+---+---+\n       0   1   2   3   4   5\n      -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1\n\n## Legacy Classes\n\nThe legacy classes `Ext.util.MixedCollection' and `{@link Ext.util.AbstractMixedCollection}`\nmay be needed if external keys are required, but for all other situations this class\nshould be used instead.\n",

The items in this array can be objects that more fully specify the\nchild. For example, the above could have used this instead to achieve the same result:\n\n     childEls: [\n         { name: 'bodyEl', itemId: 'bodyEl' }\n     ]\n\n\nUnlike a `renderTpl` where there is a single value for an instance, `{@link #cfg!childEls childEls}` are aggregated\nup the class hierarchy so that they are effectively inherited. In other words, if a\nclass where to derive from `Ext.ux.SomeComponent` in the example above, it could also\nhave a `{@link #cfg!childEls childEls}` property in the same way as `Ext.ux.SomeComponent`.\n\n     Ext.define('Ext.ux.AnotherComponent', {\n         extend: 'Ext.ux.SomeComponent',\n\n         childEls: [\n             // 'bodyEl' is inherited\n             'innerEl'\n         ],\n\n         renderTpl: [\n             '<div id=\"{id}-bodyEl\" data-ref=\"bodyEl\">'\n                 '<div id=\"{id}-innerEl\" data-ref=\"innerEl\"></div>'\n             '</div>'\n         ],\n\n         // ...\n     });\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nThe `renderTpl` contains both child elements and unites them in the desired markup, but\nthe `{@link #cfg!childEls childEls}` only contains the new child element. The `data-ref` attribute must be\nrendered on to child elements that do not use `select` or `selectNode` options.

This\n should be set on things like the generated content for an `{@link Ext.view.View}`.\n- `select`: A selector that will be passed to {@link Ext.dom.Element#method-select}.\n- `selectNode`: A selector that will be passed to\n{@link Ext.dom.Element#method-selectNode}.\n\nFor example:\n\n     childEls: {\n         button: true,\n         buttonText: 'text',\n         buttonImage: {\n             itemId: 'image'\n         }\n     }\n\nThe above is translated into the following complete form:\n\n     childEls: {\n         button: {\n             name: 'button',\n             itemId: 'button'\n         },\n         buttonText: {\n             name: 'buttonText',\n             itemId: 'text'\n         },\n         buttonImage: {\n             name: 'buttonImage',\n             itemId: 'image'\n         }\n     }\n\nThe above can be provided as an array like so:\n\n     childEls: [\n         'button',\n         { name: 'buttonText', itemId: 'text' },\n         { name: 'buttonImage', itemId: 'image' }\n     }\n\nFor example, a Component which renders a title and body text:\n\n    @example\n    Ext.create('Ext.Component', {\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        renderTpl: [\n            '<h1 id=\"{id}-title\" data-ref=\"title\">{title}</h1>',\n            '<p>{msg}</p>',\n        ],\n        renderData: {\n            title: \"Error\",\n            msg: \"Something went wrong\"\n        },\n        childEls: [\"title\"],\n        listeners: {\n            afterrender: function(cmp){\n                // After rendering the component will have a title property\n                cmp.title.setStyle({color: \"red\"});\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n**Note:** `childEl`s in the {@link Ext.Component#cfg-renderTpl renderTpl}\nmust be referenced in a **data-ref** attribute.  Notice in the above example\nthat the \"title\" `childEl` is set in the `renderTpl` using\n**data-ref=\"title\"**.\n\nWhen using `select`, the property will be an instance of {@link Ext.CompositeElement}.\nIn all other cases, the property will be an {@link Ext.dom.Element} or `null`\nif not found.\n\nCare should be taken when using `select` or `selectNode` to find child elements.\nThe following issues should be considered:\n\n- Performance: using selectors can be 10x slower than id lookup.\n- Over-selecting: selectors are applied after the DOM elements for all children\n  have been rendered, so selectors can match elements from child components\n  (including nested versions of the same component) accidentally.\n\nThis above issues are most important when using `select` since it returns multiple\nelements.\n",

Here is how we might add a rule that pluralizes\n\"ox\" to \"oxen\":\n\n    Ext.util.Inflector.plural(/^(ox)$/i, \"$1en\");\n\nEach rule consists of two items - a regular expression that matches one or more rules,\nand a replacement string. In this case, the regular expression will only match the string \"ox\",\nand will replace that match with \"oxen\". Here's how we could add the inverse rule:\n\n    Ext.util.Inflector.singular(/^(ox)en$/i, \"$1\");\n\nNote that the ox/oxen rules are present by default.\n",

This scope is\ndetermined from the `{@link #cfg!id id}` property. Further, this class does not expose the number of\nkeys in the store as a `length` property as this cannot be maintained reliably without\nundue cost. Instead there is a `{@link #method!getKeys getKeys}` method that returns the cached array of keys\nwhich is lazily populated on first call.\n\nFor example:\n\n     var store = new Ext.util.LocalStorage({\n             id: 'foo'\n         });\n\n     store.setItem('bar', 'stuff');\n\n     // Equivalent to:\n     window.localStorage.setItem('foo-bar', 'stuff');\n\nIn all cases, the `{@link #cfg!id id}` property is only used by the underlying storage and should not\nbe needed in item access calls or appear when enumerating keys.\n\nTo continue with the previous example:\n\n     var keys = store.getKeys();\n     console.log(keys.length);   // logs 1\n     console.log(store.key(0));  // logs \"bar\"\n\n## Sharing Instances\n\nThe management of the underlying storage can be broken if multiple instances of this\nclass are created with the same `{@link #cfg!id id}` simultaneously. To avoid creating multiple instances\nwith the same `{@link #cfg!id id}`, use the `{@link #static-method!get get}` method and it will lazily create and share a single\ninstance. When you are done with the shared instance, call `{@link #method!release release}`.\n\n     var storage = Ext.util.LocalStorage.get('id');\n\n     ...\n\n     storage.release(); // do not call `{@link #method!destroy destroy}` as others may be using this object\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Do not mix direction instantiation and `{@link #static-method!get get}` with the same `{@link #cfg!id id}`.\n\n## Legacy IE\n\nOlder IE browsers (specifically IE7 and below) do not support `localStorage` so this\nclass provides equivalent support using the IE proprietary persistence mechanism: the\n[`userData` behavior](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531424(VS.85).aspx).

Its result is obtained by calling #getElConfig.\n - The #getElConfig method uses the `renderTpl` and its render data as the content\n   of the `autoEl` described element.\n - The result of `getRenderTree` is passed to {@link Ext.dom.Helper#append}.\n - The `renderTpl` contains calls to render things like docked items, container items\n   and raw markup (such as the `html` or `tpl` config properties). These calls are to\n   methods added to the {@link Ext.XTemplate} instance by #setupRenderTpl.\n - The #setupRenderTpl method adds methods such as `renderItems`, `renderContent`, etc.\n   to the template. These are directed to \"doRenderItems\", \"doRenderContent\" etc..\n - The #setupRenderTpl calls traverse from components to their {@link Ext.layout.Layout}\n   object.\n - When a container is rendered, it also has a `renderTpl`. This is processed when the\n   `renderContainer` method is called in the component's `renderTpl`. This call goes to\n   Ext.layout.container.Container#doRenderContainer. This method repeats this\n   process for all components in the container.\n - After the top-most component's markup is generated and placed in to the DOM, the next\n   step is to link elements to their components and finish calling the component methods\n   `{@link #method!onRender onRender}` and `{@link #method!afterRender afterRender}` as well as fire the corresponding events.\n - The first step in this is to call #finishRender. This method descends the\n   component hierarchy and calls `{@link #method!onRender onRender}` and fires the `{@link #method!render render}` event. These calls\n   are delivered top-down to approximate the timing of these calls/events from previous\n   versions.\n - During the pass, the component's `el` is set. Likewise, the `renderSelectors` and\n   `childEls` are applied to capture references to the component's elements.\n - These calls are also made on the {@link Ext.layout.container.Container} layout to\n   capture its elements. Both of these classes use {@link Ext.util.ElementContainer} to\n   handle `childEls` processing.\n",

Attempting to\nmeasure text that includes HTML may return inaccurate results.\n\nThis measurement works by copying the relevant font-related CSS styles from the element\nparam to the TextMetrics' cached measurement element.  This returns the dimensions of the cached\nelement wrapping the text.  By default, the wrapping element is auto-sized.\nYou must provide a **fixed width** if the passed text is multi-lined.\n\nWhen multiple measurements are being done with the same element styling, you should\ncreate a single, reusable TextMetrics instance.  This is more efficient than using the\nstatic {@link #measure} method.  The element styles are copied to the cached\nTextMetrics element once during instantiation versus repeated copying using\n_measure()_.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the recommended use of TextMetrics where the custom\ntextfield class sets up a reusable TextMetrics instance used to measure the label\nwidth. This example assumes that all instances of _mytextfield_ have the same\n{@link Ext.form.Labelable#labelClsExtra labelClsExtra} and\n{@link Ext.form.Labelable#labelStyle labelStyle} configs.\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.view.MyTextField', {\n        extend: 'Ext.form.field.Text',\n        xtype: 'mytextfield',\n\n        initComponent: function () {\n            var me = this,\n                tm = me.getTextMetrics();\n\n            me.labelWidth = tm.getWidth(me.fieldLabel + me.labelSeparator);\n            me.callParent();\n        },\n\n        getTextMetrics: function () {\n            var me = this,\n                // Using me.self allows labelCls etc. to vary by derived\n                // class, but not by instance.\n                cls = me.self,\n                tm = cls.measurer,\n                el;\n\n            if (!tm) {\n                el = Ext.getBody().createChild();\n                el.addCls(me.labelCls + ' ' + me.labelClsExtra).\n                    applyStyles(me.labelStyle);\n\n                cls.measurer = tm = new Ext.util.TextMetrics(el);\n            }\n\n            return tm;\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        title: 'Contact Info',\n        width: 600,\n        bodyPadding: 10,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        items: [{\n            xtype: 'mytextfield',\n            fieldLabel: 'Name',\n            labelStyle: 'font-size: 10px;'\n        }, {\n            xtype: 'mytextfield',\n            fieldLabel: 'Email Address',\n            labelStyle: 'font-size: 10px;'\n        }]\n    });\n\nWhile less efficient than the preceding example, this example allows each instance of\n_mytextfield2_ to have unique labelClsExtra and labelStyle configs.  Each custom\ntextfield instance uses the static TextMetrics measure method which will copy the\nlabel styles repeatedly, thus being less efficient but more versatile.\n\n    Ext.define('MyApp.view.MyTextField2', {\n        extend: 'Ext.form.field.Text',\n        xtype: 'mytextfield2',\n\n        initComponent: function () {\n            var me = this,\n                el = me.getMeasurementEl(),\n                tm = Ext.util.TextMetrics;\n\n            me.labelWidth = tm.measure(el, me.fieldLabel + me.labelSeparator).width;\n            me.callParent();\n        },\n\n        getMeasurementEl: function () {\n            var me = this,\n                cls = MyApp.view.MyTextField2,\n                el = cls.measureEl;\n\n            if (!el) {\n                cls.measureEl = el = Ext.getBody().createChild();\n            }\n\n            el.dom.removeAttribute('style');\n            el.removeCls(el.dom.className).\n                addCls(me.labelCls + ' ' + me.labelClsExtra).\n                applyStyles(me.labelStyle);\n\n            return el;\n        }\n    });\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {\n        title: 'Contact Info',\n        width: 600,\n        bodyPadding: 10,\n        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),\n        items: [{\n            xtype: 'mytextfield2',\n            fieldLabel: 'Name',\n            labelStyle: 'font-size: 14px;font-weight: bold;',\n            labelClsExtra: 'nameLabel'\n        }, {\n            xtype: 'mytextfield2',\n            fieldLabel: 'Email Address',\n            labelStyle: 'font-size: 10px;',\n            labelClsExtra: 'emailLabel'\n        }]\n    });\n",

The events recorded by the\n{@link Ext.ux.event.Recorder} class are designed to serve as input for this class.\n\nThe simplest use of this class is to instantiate it with an {@link #eventQueue} and call\n{@link #method-start}. Like so:\n\n     var player = Ext.create('Ext.ux.event.Player', {\n         eventQueue: [ ... ],\n         speed: 2,  // play at 2x speed\n         listeners: {\n             stop: function() {\n                 player = null; // all done\n             }\n         }\n     });\n\n     player.start();\n\nA more complex use would be to incorporate keyframe generation after playing certain\nevents.\n\n     var player = Ext.create('Ext.ux.event.Player', {\n         eventQueue: [ ... ],\n         keyFrameEvents: {\n             click: true\n         },\n         listeners: {\n             stop: function() {\n                 // play has completed... probably time for another keyframe...\n                 player = null;\n             },\n             keyframe: onKeyFrame\n         }\n     });\n\n     player.start();\n\nIf a keyframe can be handled immediately (synchronously), the listener would be:\n\n     function onKeyFrame () {\n         handleKeyFrame();\n     }\n\n If the keyframe event is always handled asynchronously, then the event listener is only\n a bit more:\n\n     function onKeyFrame (p, eventDescriptor) {\n         eventDescriptor.defer(); // pause event playback...\n\n         handleKeyFrame(function() {\n             eventDescriptor.finish(); // ...resume event playback\n         });\n     }\n\nFinally, if the keyframe could be either handled synchronously or asynchronously (perhaps\ndifferently by browser), a slightly more complex listener is required.\n\n     function onKeyFrame (p, eventDescriptor) {\n         var async;\n\n         handleKeyFrame(function() {\n             // either this callback is being called immediately by handleKeyFrame (in\n             // which case async is undefined) or it is being called later (in which case\n             // async will be true).\n\n             if (async) {\n                 eventDescriptor.finish();\n             }\n             else {\n                 async = false;\n             }\n         });\n\n         // either the callback was called (and async is now false) or it was not\n         // called (and async remains undefined).\n\n         if (async !== false) {\n             eventDescriptor.defer();\n             async = true; // let the callback know that we have gone async\n         }\n     }\n",

The style sheet must\nprovide the rules to select the desired size using the {@link #responsivecolumn-item}\nmixin.\n\nFor example, a panel in a responsive column layout might add the following styles:\n\n     .my-panel {\n         // consume 50% of the available space inside the container by default\n         @include responsivecolumn-item(50%);\n\n         .x-responsivecolumn-small & {\n             // consume 100% of available space in \"small\" mode\n             // (viewport width < 1000 by default)\n             @include responsivecolumn-item(100%);\n         }\n     }\n\nAlternatively, instead of targeting specific panels in CSS, you can create reusable\nclasses:\n\n     .big-50 {\n         // consume 50% of the available space inside the container by default\n         @include responsivecolumn-item(50%);\n     }\n\n     .x-responsivecolumn-small {\n         > .small-100 {\n             @include responsivecolumn-item(100%);\n         }\n     }\n\nThese can be added to components in the layout using the `responsiveCls` config:\n\n     items: [{\n         xtype: 'my-panel',\n\n         // Use 50% of space when viewport is \"big\" and 100% when viewport\n         // is \"small\":\n         responsiveCls: 'big-50 small-100'\n     }]\n\nThe `responsiveCls` config is provided by this layout to avoid overwriting classes\nspecified using `cls` or other standard configs.\n\nInternally, this layout simply uses `float:left` and CSS `calc()` (except on IE8) to\n\"flex\" each item. The calculation is always based on a percentage with a spacing taken\ninto account to separate the items from each other.\n",

        "type": "Ext.Version",
        "doc": "\nA utility class that wraps around a version number string and provides convenient methods\nto perform comparisons. A version number is expressed in the following general format:\n\n    major[.minor[.patch[.build[release]]]]\n\nThe `Version` instance holds various readonly properties that contain the digested form\nof the version string. The numeric componnets of `{@link #property!major major}`, `{@link #property!minor minor}`, `{@link #property!patch patch}` and `{@link #property!build build}`\nas well as the textual suffix called `{@link #property!release release}`.\n\nNot depicted in the above syntax are three possible prefixes used to control partial\nmatching. These are '^' (the default), '>' and '~'. These are discussed below.\n\nExamples:\n\n    var version = new Ext.Version('1.0.2beta'); // or maybe \"1.0\" or \"1.2.3.4RC\"\n    console.log(\"Version is \" + version); // Version is 1.0.2beta\n\n    console.log(version.getMajor()); // 1\n    console.log(version.getMinor()); // 0\n    console.log(version.getPatch()); // 2\n    console.log(version.getBuild()); // 0\n    console.log(version.getRelease()); // beta\n\nThe understood values of `{@link #property!release release}` are assigned numberic equivalents for the sake of\ncomparsion. The order of these from smallest to largest is as follows:\n\n * `\"dev\"`\n * `\"alpha\"` or `\"a\"`\n * `\"beta\"` or `\"b\"`\n * `\"RC\"` or `\"rc\"`\n * `\"#\"`\n * `\"pl\"` or `\"p\"`\n\nAny other (unrecognized) suffix is consider greater than any of these.\n\n## Comparisons\nThere are two forms of comparison that are commonly needed: full and partial. Full\ncomparison is simpler and is also the default.\n\nExample:\n\n    var version = new Ext.Version('1.0.2beta');\n\n    console.log(version.isGreaterThan('1.0.1')); // True\n    console.log(version.isGreaterThan('1.0.2alpha')); // True\n    console.log(version.isGreaterThan('1.0.2RC')); // False\n    console.log(version.isGreaterThan('1.0.2')); // False\n    console.log(version.isLessThan('1.0.2')); // True\n\n    console.log(version.match(1.0)); // True (using a Number)\n    console.log(version.match('1.0.2')); // True (using a String)\n\nThese comparisons are ultimately implemented by {@link Ext.Version#compareTo compareTo}\nwhich returns -1, 0 or 1 depending on whether the `Version' instance is less than, equal\nto, or greater than the given \"other\" version.\n\nFor example:\n\n     var n = version.compareTo('1.0.1');  // == 1  (because 1.0.2beta > 1.0.1)\n\n     n = version.compareTo('1.1');  // == -1\n     n = version.compareTo(version); // == 0\n\n### Partial Comparisons\nBy default, unspecified version number fields are filled with 0. In other words, the\nversion number fields are 0-padded on the right or a \"lower bound\". This produces the\nmost commonly used forms of comparsion:\n\n     var ver = new Version('4.2');\n\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.2.1'); // == -1  (4.2 promotes to 4.2.0 and is less than 4.2.1)\n\nThere are two other ways to interpret comparisons of versions of different length. The\nfirst of these is to change the padding on the right to be a large number (scuh as\nInfinity) instead of 0. This has the effect of making the version an upper bound. For\nexample:\n\n     var ver = new Version('^4.2'); // NOTE: the '^' prefix used\n\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.3'); // == -1  (less than 4.3)\n\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.2'); // == 1   (greater than all 4.2's)\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.2.1'); // == 1\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.2.9'); // == 1\n\nThe second way to interpret this comparison is to ignore the extra digits, making the\nmatch a prefix match. For example:\n\n     var ver = new Version('~4.2'); // NOTE: the '~' prefix used\n\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.3'); // == -1\n\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.2'); // == 0\n     n = ver.compareTo('4.2.1'); // == 0\n\nThis final form can be useful when version numbers contain more components than are\nimportant for certain comparisons. For example, the full version of Ext JS 4.2.1 is\n\"4.2.1.883\" where 883 is the `{@link #property!build build}` number.\n\nThis is how to create a \"partial\" `Version` and compare versions to it:\n\n     var version421ish = new Version('~4.2.1');\n\n     n = version421ish.compareTo('4.2.1.883'); // == 0\n     n = version421ish.compareTo('4.2.1.2'); // == 0\n     n = version421ish.compareTo('4.2.1'); // == 0\n\n     n = version421ish.compareTo('4.2'); // == 1\n\nIn the above example, '4.2.1.2' compares as equal to '4.2.1' because digits beyond the\ngiven \"4.2.1\" are ignored. However, '4.2' is less than the '4.2.1' prefix; its missing\ndigit is filled with 0.\n",

Accepted keys are:\n\n- `panX`\n- `panY`\n- `pinchZoom`\n- `doubleTapZoom`\n\nAll touch actions are enabled (`true`) by default, so it is usually only necessary\nto specify which touch actions to disable.  For example, the following disables\nonly horizontal scrolling and pinch-to-zoom on the component's main element:\n\n    touchAction: {\n        panX: false,\n        pinchZoom: false\n    }\n\nTouch actions can be specified on reference elements using the reference element\nname, for example:\n\n    // disables horizontal scrolling on the main element, and double-tap-zoom\n    // on the child element named \"body\"\n    touchAction: {\n        panY: false\n        body: {\n            doubleTapZoom: false\n        }\n    }\n\nThe primary motivation for setting the touch-action of an element is to prevent\nthe browser's default handling of a gesture such as pinch-to-zoom, or\ndrag-to-scroll, so that the application can implement its own handling of that\ngesture on the element.  Suppose, for example, a component has a custom drag\nhandler on its element and wishes to prevent horizontal scrolling of its container\nwhile it is being dragged:\n\n    Ext.create('Ext.Widget', {\n        touchAction: {\n            panX: false\n        },\n        listeners: {\n            drag: function(e) {\n                // implement drag logic\n            }\n        }\n    });\n",

The singleton instance,\nExt.MessageBox alias `{@link Ext.Msg}` can also be used.\n\nNote that a MessageBox is asynchronous.  Unlike a regular JavaScript `{@link #method!alert alert}` (which will halt\nbrowser execution), showing a MessageBox will not cause the code to stop.  For this reason,\nif you have code that should only run *after* some user feedback from the MessageBox,\nyou must use a callback function (see the `function` parameter for {@link #method-show}\nfor more details).\n\nBasic alert\n\n    @example\n    Ext.Msg.alert('Status', 'Changes saved successfully.');\n\nPrompt for user data and process the result using a callback\n\n    @example\n    Ext.Msg.prompt('Name', 'Please enter your name:', function(btn, text){\n        if (btn == 'ok'){\n            // process text value and close...\n        }\n    });\n\nShow a dialog using config options\n\n    @example\n    Ext.Msg.show({\n        title:'Save Changes?',\n        message: 'You are closing a tab that has unsaved changes. Do you want to save changes?',\n        buttons: Ext.Msg.YESNOCANCEL,\n        icon: Ext.Msg.QUESTION,\n        fn: function(btn) {\n            if (btn === 'yes') {\n                console.log('Yes pressed');\n            } else if (btn === 'no') {\n                console.log('No pressed');\n            } else {\n                console.log('Cancel pressed');\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nShowing Ext.Msg while it's already shown will cause the visible instance to be\noverwritten with the newly passed config.

This variable will represent the value of the array\nat the current index:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>{name}\\'s favorite beverages:</p>',\n        '<tpl for=\"drinks\">',\n            '<div> - {.}</div>',\n        '</tpl>'\n    );\n    tpl.overwrite(panel.body, data);\n\nWhen processing a sub-template, for example while looping through a child array, you can access\nthe parent object's members via the **parent** object:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '<tpl if=\"age &gt; 1\">',\n                '<p>{name}</p>',\n                '<p>Dad: {parent.name}</p>',\n            '</tpl>',\n        '</tpl></p>'\n    );\n    tpl.overwrite(panel.body, data);\n\nThe **foreach** operator is used to loop over an object's properties.  The following\nexample demonstrates looping over the main data object's properties:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<dl>',\n            '<tpl foreach=\".\">',\n                // the special **`{$}`** variable contains the property name\n                '<dt>{$}</dt>',\n                // within the loop, the **`{.}`** variable is set to the property value\n                '<dd>{.}</dd>',\n            '</tpl>',\n        '</dl>'\n    );\n    tpl.overwrite(panel.body, data);\n\n# Conditional processing with basic comparison operators\n\nThe **tpl** tag and the **if** operator are used to provide conditional checks for deciding\nwhether or not to render specific parts of the template.\n\nUsing the sample data above:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '<tpl if=\"age &gt; 1\">',\n                '<p>{name}</p>',\n            '</tpl>',\n        '</tpl></p>'\n    );\n    tpl.overwrite(panel.body, data);\n\nMore advanced conditionals are also supported:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '<p>{name} is a ',\n            '<tpl if=\"age &gt;= 13\">',\n                '<p>teenager</p>',\n            '<tpl elseif=\"age &gt;= 2\">',\n                '<p>kid</p>',\n            '<tpl else>',\n                '<p>baby</p>',\n            '</tpl>',\n        '</tpl></p>'\n    );\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '<p>{name} is a ',\n            '<tpl switch=\"name\">',\n                '<tpl case=\"Aubrey\" case=\"Nikol\">',\n                    '<p>girl</p>',\n                '<tpl default>',\n                    '<p>boy</p>',\n            '</tpl>',\n        '</tpl></p>'\n    );\n\nA `break` is implied between each case and default, however, multiple cases can be listed\nin a single &lt;tpl&gt; tag.\n\n# Using double quotes\n\nExamples:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        \"<tpl if='age &gt; 1 && age &lt; 10'>Child</tpl>\",\n        \"<tpl if='age &gt;= 10 && age &lt; 18'>Teenager</tpl>\",\n        \"<tpl if='this.isGirl(name)'>...</tpl>\",\n        '<tpl if=\"id == \\'download\\'\">...</tpl>',\n        \"<tpl if='needsIcon'><img src='{icon}' class='{iconCls}'/></tpl>\",\n        \"<tpl if='name == \\\"Don\\\"'>Hello</tpl>\"\n    );\n\n# Basic math support\n\nThe following basic math operators may be applied directly on numeric data values:\n\n    + - * /\n\nFor example:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '<tpl if=\"age &gt; 1\">',  // <-- Note that the > is encoded\n                '<p>{#}: {name}</p>',  // <-- Auto-number each item\n                '<p>In 5 Years: {age+5}</p>',  // <-- Basic math\n                '<p>Dad: {parent.name}</p>',\n            '</tpl>',\n        '</tpl></p>'\n    );\n    tpl.overwrite(panel.body, data);\n\n# Execute arbitrary inline code with special built-in template variables\n\nAnything between `{[ ... ]}` is considered code to be executed in the scope of the template.\nThe expression is evaluated and the result is included in the generated result. There are\nsome special variables available in that code:\n\n- **out**: The output array into which the template is being appended (using `push` to later\n  `join`).\n- **values**: The values in the current scope. If you are using scope changing sub-templates,\n  you can change what values is.\n- **parent**: The scope (values) of the ancestor template.\n- **xindex**: If you are in a \"for\" or \"foreach\" looping template, the index of the loop you\n are in (1-based).\n- **xcount**: If you are in a \"for\" looping template, the total length of the array you are\n looping.\n- **xkey**: If you are in a \"foreach\" looping template, the key of the current property\nbeing examined.\n\nThis example demonstrates basic row striping using an inline code block and the xindex variable:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Company: {[values.company.toUpperCase() + \", \" + values.title]}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '<div class=\"{[xindex % 2 === 0 ? \"even\" : \"odd\"]}\">',\n            '{name}',\n            '</div>',\n        '</tpl></p>'\n     );\n\nAny code contained in \"verbatim\" blocks (using \"{% ... %}\") will be inserted directly in\nthe generated code for the template. These blocks are not included in the output. This\ncan be used for simple things like break/continue in a loop, or control structures or\nmethod calls (when they don't produce output). The `this` references the template instance.\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Company: {[values.company.toUpperCase() + \", \" + values.title]}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '{% if (xindex % 2 === 0) continue; %}',\n            '{name}',\n            '{% if (xindex > 100) break; %}',\n            '</div>',\n        '</tpl></p>'\n     );\n\n# Template member functions\n\nOne or more member functions can be specified in a configuration object passed into the\nXTemplate constructor for more complex processing:\n\n    var tpl = new Ext.XTemplate(\n        '<p>Name: {name}</p>',\n        '<p>Kids: ',\n        '<tpl for=\"kids\">',\n            '<tpl if=\"this.isGirl(name)\">',\n                '<p>Girl: {name} - {age}</p>',\n            '<tpl else>',\n                '<p>Boy: {name} - {age}</p>',\n            '</tpl>',\n            '<tpl if=\"this.isBaby(age)\">',\n                '<p>{name} is a baby!</p>',\n            '</tpl>',\n        '</tpl></p>',\n        {\n            // XTemplate configuration:\n            disableFormats: true,\n            // member functions:\n            isGirl: function(name){\n               return name == 'Aubrey' || name == 'Nikol';\n            },\n            isBaby: function(age){\n               return age < 1;\n            }\n        }\n    );\n    tpl.overwrite(panel.body, data);\n",
